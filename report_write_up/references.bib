  abstract = {Insecticide imidacloprid and herbicide glyphosate have a broad spectrum of applicable use in the agricultural sector of Egypt. Their ability to induce in vitro cytotoxic and oxidative stress on normal human cells (prostate epithelial WPM-Y.1 cell line) was evaluated with the methyl tetrazolium test (MTT) and histopathological investigation. Cell viability was evaluated with an MTT test for 24\,h. The median inhibition concentration (IC50) values were 0.023 and 0.025\,mM for imidacloprid and glyphosate, respectively. Sublethal concentrations: 1/10 and 1/50 of IC50 and IC50 levels significantly induced an increase in the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) level compared with the untreated cells. Rapid decrease in the glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity was induced. Significant increases were recorded in activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR), respectively, compared with the control group. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) investigation showed significant defects in the cells following pesticide treatments for 24\,h. Therefore, it is concluded that imidacloprid and glyphosate are very toxic in vitro assays and able to induce apoptotic effects as well as oxidative stress. So, these findings provide a scenario of multibiomarkers to achieve the imposed risks of pesticides at low doses.},

  abstract = {Systemic insecticides are applied to plants using a wide variety of methods, ranging from foliar sprays to seed treatments and soil drenches. Neonicotinoids and fipronil are among the most widely used pesticides in the world. Their popularity is largely due to their high toxicity to invertebrates, the ease and flexibility with which they can be applied, their long persistence, and their systemic nature, which ensures that they spread to all parts of the target crop. However, these properties also increase the probability of environmental contamination and exposure of nontarget organisms. Environmental contamination occurs via a number of routes including dust generated during drilling of dressed seeds, contamination and accumulation in arable soils and soil water, runoff into waterways, and uptake of pesticides by nontarget plants via their roots or dust deposition on leaves. Persistence in soils, waterways, and nontarget plants is variable but can be prolonged; for example, the half-lives of neonicotinoids in soils can exceed 1,000~days, so they can accumulate when used repeatedly. Similarly, they can persist in woody plants for periods exceeding 1~year. Breakdown results in toxic metabolites, though concentrations of these in the environment are rarely measured. Overall, there is strong evidence that soils, waterways, and plants in agricultural environments and neighboring areas are contaminated with variable levels of neonicotinoids or fipronil mixtures and their metabolites (soil, parts per billion (ppb)-parts per million (ppm) range; water, parts per trillion (ppt)-ppb range; and plants, ppb-ppm range). This provides multiple routes for chronic (and acute in some cases) exposure of nontarget animals. For example, pollinators are exposed through direct contact with dust during drilling; consumption of pollen, nectar, or guttation drops from seed-treated crops, water, and consumption of contaminated pollen and nectar from wild flowers and trees growing near-treated crops. Studies of food stores in honeybee colonies from across the globe demonstrate that colonies are routinely and chronically exposed to neonicotinoids, fipronil, and their metabolites (generally in the 1–100~ppb range), mixed with other pesticides some of which are known to act synergistically with neonicotinoids. Other nontarget organisms, particularly those inhabiting soils, aquatic habitats, or herbivorous insects feeding on noncrop plants in farmland, will also inevitably receive exposure, although data are generally lacking for these groups. We summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the environmental fate of these compounds by outlining what is known about the chemical properties of these compounds, and placing these properties in the context of modern agricultural practices.},

  abstract = {To sustain the quantity and quantity to fulfill the increased food demand of the rapidly growing population, agricultural industry plays an important role in the survival of nations. The agricultural industry has undertaken numerous scientific innovations to make it highly efficient and sustainable. However, if such improvements have resulted in enhanced yields, they have concurrently also triggered the degradation of the environment. One such problem is posed by organophosphate pesticides that are being extensively utilized in agricultural practices and other activities because of their greater efficiency and lesser environmental persistence. But utilization of these pesticides poses a threat to the environment because of their toxic nature and persistence in the food chain. Residues of these pesticides usually get build up in the upper surface of the soil and ultimately find their way into the food products. Once consumed by the humans and other living organisms, these pesticides affect not only them but also the population of various groups of soil microbes and their biochemical activities in the soil. Bacteria, fungi, and plants have demonstrated the capability to degrade these pesticides from the environment. Hence, bioremediation has been considered as an attractive, potentially appropriate, efficient, cost-effective, and an eco-friendly method for decontamination of pesticide-contaminated sites. Therefore, in this chapter, an attempt has been made to provide an overview of various types of pesticides, followed by analyzing the impacts of organophosphates, their toxicological mechanism, pollution status, and biodegradation in the environment.},

  abstract = {Conserving pollinator services for crops If pollination fails, ecosystems are eroded and we will lose reliable sources of many critical foodstuffs. Focusing on the pollination services provided by bees, Goulson et al. review the stresses bees are experiencing from climate change, infectious diseases, and insecticides. We can mitigate some of the stress on bees by improving floral resources and adopting quarantine measures, and by surveillance of bee populations. Crucially, we need to resolve the controversy surrounding prophylactic use of pesticides. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1255957 Structured Abstract BACKGROUND The species richness of wild bees and other pollinators has declined over the past 50 years, with some species undergoing major declines and a few going extinct. Evidence of the causes of these losses is patchy and incomplete, owing to inadequate monitoring systems. Managed honey bee stocks have also declined in North America and many European countries, although they have increased substantially in China. During this same period, the demand for insect pollination of crops has approximately tripled, and the importance of wild pollinators in providing such services has become increasingly apparent, leading to concern that we may be nearing a “pollination crisis” in which crop yields begin to fall. This has stimulated much-needed research into the causes of bee declines. Habitat loss, which has reduced the abundance and diversity of floral resources and nesting opportunities, has undoubtedly been a major long-term driver through the 20th century and still continues today. In addition, both wild and managed bees have been exposed to a succession of emerging parasites and pathogens that have been accidentally moved around the world by human action. The intensification of agriculture and increasing reliance on pesticides means that pollinators are also chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals. Predicted changes in global climate are likely to further exacerbate such problems in the future. ADVANCES It has lately become clear that stressors do not act in isolation and that their interactions may be difficult to predict; for example, some pesticides act synergistically rather than additively. Both pesticide exposure and food stress can impair immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple interacting stressors is driving honey bee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators, but the precise combination apparently differs from place to place. Although the causes of pollinator decline may be complex and subject to disagreement, solutions need not be; taking steps to reduce or remove any of these stresses is likely to benefit pollinator health. Several techniques are available that have been demonstrated to effectively increase floral availability in farmland. Similarly, encouraging gardeners to grow appropriate bee-friendly flowers and to improve management of amenity grasslands can also reduce dietary stress. Retaining or restoring areas of seminatural habitat within farmland will improve nest site availability. A return to the principles of integrated pest management and avoidance of prophylactic use of agrochemicals could greatly decrease exposure of bees to pesticides. OUTLOOK Interactions among agrochemicals and stressors are not addressed by current regulatory procedures, which typically expose well-fed, parasite-free bees to a single pesticide for a short period of time. Devising approaches to study these interactions and incorporating them into the regulatory process poses a major challenge. In the meantime, providing support and advice for farmers in more sustainable farming methods with reduced pesticide use is likely to have broad benefits for farmland biodiversity. Enforcing effective quarantine measures on bee movements to prevent further spread of bee parasites is also vital. Finally, effective monitoring of wild pollinator populations is urgently needed to inform management strategies. Without this, we have no early warning system to tell us how close we may be to a pollination crisis. With a growing human population and rapid growth in global demand for pollination services, we cannot afford to see crop yields begin to fall, and we would be well advised to take preemptive action to ensure that we have adequate pollination services into the future. {$<$}img class={"}fragment-image{"} aria-describedby={"}F1-caption{"} src={"}https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6229/1255957/F1.medium.gif{"}/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Multiple interacting stressors drive bee declines. Both wild and managed bees are subject to a number of important and interacting stressors. For example, exposure to some fungicides can greatly increase the toxicity of insecticides, whereas exposure to insecticides reduces resistance to diseases. Dietary stresses are likely to reduce the ability of bees to cope with both toxins and pathogens. Photo credit: DAVE GOULSON Bees are subject to numerous pressures in the modern world. The abundance and diversity of flowers has declined; bees are chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals, and they are simultaneously exposed to novel parasites accidentally spread by humans. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these problems in the future. Stressors do not act in isolation; for example, pesticide exposure can impair both detoxification mechanisms and immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple interacting stressors is driving honey bee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators, but such interactions are not addressed by current regulatory procedures, and studying these interactions experimentally poses a major challenge. In the meantime, taking steps to reduce stress on bees would seem prudent; incorporating flower-rich habitat into farmland, reducing pesticide use through adopting more sustainable farming methods, and enforcing effective quarantine measures on bee movements are all practical measures that should be adopted. Effective monitoring of wild pollinator populations is urgently needed to inform management strategies into the future.},

  abstract = {Since their discovery in the late 1980s, neonicotinoid pesticides have become the most widely used class of insecticides worldwide, with large-scale applications ranging from plant protection (crops, vegetables, fruits), veterinary products, and biocides to invertebrate pest control in fish farming. In this review, we address the phenyl-pyrazole fipronil together with neonicotinoids because of similarities in their toxicity, physicochemical profiles, and presence in the environment. Neonicotinoids and fipronil currently account for approximately one third of the world insecticide market; the annual world production of the archetype neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, was estimated to be ca. 20,000~tonnes active substance in 2010. There were several reasons for the initial success of neonicotinoids and fipronil: (1) there was no known pesticide resistance in target pests, mainly because of their recent development, (2) their physicochemical properties included many advantages over previous generations of insecticides (i.e., organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, etc.), and (3) they shared an assumed reduced operator and consumer risk. Due to their systemic nature, they are taken up by the roots or leaves and translocated to all parts of the plant, which, in turn, makes them effectively toxic to herbivorous insects. The toxicity persists for a variable period of time—depending on the plant, its growth stage, and the amount of pesticide applied. A wide variety of applications are available, including the most common prophylactic non-Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) application by seed coating. As a result of their extensive use and physicochemical properties, these substances can be found in all environmental compartments including soil, water, and air. Neonicotinoids and fipronil operate by disrupting neural transmission in the central nervous system of invertebrates. Neonicotinoids mimic the action of neurotransmitters, while fipronil inhibits neuronal receptors. In doing so, they continuously stimulate neurons leading ultimately to death of target invertebrates. Like virtually all insecticides, they can also have lethal and sublethal impacts on non-target organisms, including insect predators and vertebrates. Furthermore, a range of synergistic effects with other stressors have been documented. Here, we review extensively their metabolic pathways, showing how they form both compound-specific and common metabolites which can themselves be toxic. These may result in prolonged toxicity. Considering their wide commercial expansion, mode of action, the systemic properties in plants, persistence and environmental fate, coupled with limited information about the toxicity profiles of these compounds and their metabolites, neonicotinoids and fipronil may entail significant risks to the environment. A global evaluation of the potential collateral effects of their use is therefore timely. The present paper and subsequent chapters in this review of the global literature explore these risks and show a growing body of evidence that persistent, low concentrations of these insecticides pose serious risks of undesirable environmental impacts.},

  abstract = {The Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of 1996 requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency to consider the cumulative effects of exposure to pesticides having a ‘common mechanism of toxicity.’ This paper reviews the information available on the acute neurotoxicity and mechanisms of toxic action of pyrethroid insecticides in mammals from the perspective of the ‘common mechanism’ statute of the FQPA. The principal effects of pyrethroids as a class are various signs of excitatory neurotoxicity. Historically, pyrethroids were grouped into two subclasses (Types I and II) based on chemical structure and the production of either the T (tremor) or CS (choreoathetosis with salivation) intoxication syndrome following intravenous or intracerebral administration to rodents. Although this classification system is widely employed, it has several shortcomings for the identification of common toxic effects. In particular, it does not reflect the diversity of intoxication signs found following oral administration of various pyrethroids. Pyrethroids act in vitro on a variety of putative biochemical and physiological target sites, four of which merit consideration as sites of toxic action. Voltage-sensitive sodium channels, the sites of insecticidal action, are also important target sites in mammals. Unlike insects, mammals have multiple sodium channel isoforms that vary in their biophysical and pharmacological properties, including their differential sensitivity to pyrethroids. Pyrethroids also act on some isoforms of voltage-sensitive calcium and chloride channels, and these effects may contribute to the toxicity of some compounds. Effects on peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors are unlikely to be a principal cause of pyrethroid intoxication but may contribute to or enhance convulsions caused by actions at other target sites. In contrast, other putative target sites that have been identified in vitro do not appear to play a major role in pyrethroid intoxication. The diverse toxic actions and pharmacological effects of pyrethroids suggest that simple additivity models based on combined actions at a single target are not appropriate to assess the risks of cumulative exposure to multiple pyrethroids.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by organophosphates may be involved in the toxicity of various pesticides. Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate how an organophosphate insecticide, phosalone, affects lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the antioxidant defence system in vitro. For this purpose, the effects of various doses of phosalone on LPO and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) in erythrocytes were studied. Each phosalone dose was incubated with a previously prepared erythrocyte sample at +4~°C for 0, 60 and 180 min. After incubation, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activities of SOD, GSH-Px and CAT were determined. Phosalone caused an increase in MDA formation and a decrease in the activities of SOD, GSH-Px and CAT. However, these effects were seen only at extremely high concentrations of phosalone and these concentrations were in the lethal range. Therefore, we suggest that ROS may not involve in the toxic effects of the pesticidal use of phosalone in low concentrations.},

  abstract = {Imidacloprid is the most important example of the neonicotinoid insecticides known to target the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in insects, and potentially in mammals. In the present study, oxidant and inflammatory responses to chronic exposure of imidacloprid was studied in rats. Wistar rats were randomly allocated into two groups as control and imidacloprid-exposed group (n=10rat/each group). 1mg/kg/BW/day imidacloprid was administrated orally by gavage for 30days. After exposure, rats were euthanized and liver and brain samples were surgically removed for analyses. Imidacloprid application caused a significant increase in nitric oxide production in brain (p{$<$}0.05) and liver (p{$<$}0.001). The quantitative analyses of mRNA confirmed the finding that imidacloprid induced the mRNA transcriptions of the three isoforms of nitric oxide synthases (iNOS, eNOS, nNOS) in brain and two isoforms (iNOS, eNOS) in the liver. Exposure to imidacloprid caused significant lipid peroxidation in plasma, brain (p{$<$}0.001) and liver (p{$<$}0.003). While the superoxide-generating enzyme xanthine oxidase activity was elevated in both tissues (p{$<$}0.001), myeloperoxidase activity was increased only in the liver (p{$<$}0.001). Antioxidant enzyme activities showed various alterations following exposure, but a significantly depleted antioxidant glutathione level was detected in brain (p{$<$}0.008). Evidence of chronic inflammation by imidacloprid was observed as induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 and IFN-γ in the liver and brain. In conclusion, chronic imidacloprid exposure causes oxidative stress and inflammation by altering antioxidant systems and inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the liver and central nervous system of non-target organisms.},

The results demonstrated that the median lethal dose (LD50) of imidacloprid after 24h was 149.76mg/kg bw. The oral administration of 14.976mg/kg imidacloprid significantly caused elevation in LPO level and the activities of antioxidant enzymes including CAT, SOD, GPx and GST. However, G6PD activity remained unchanged, while the level of GSH content was decreased.

Malathion was administered intraperitoneally in the acute and chronic protocols in the doses of 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg malathion/kg. The results showed that LPO in brain increased in both protocols. The increased oxidative stress resulted in an increased in the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), observed in cortex, striatum in the acute malathion protocol and hippocampus in the chronic malathion protocol.

The present study on rat exposed to two pyrethroids, cypermethrin and permethrin, showed different lymphocyte DNA damage depending on the type of pyrethroid, the dose, and the period of treatment. Data obtained from comet assay showed that oral treatment with 150mg/kg body weight/day of permethrin (corresponding to 1/10 of LD50) for 60 days, induced a significant increase in all comet parameters. No lymphocyte DNA damage was measured after treatment with 25mg/kg body weight/day of cypermethrin (corresponding to 1/10 of LD50) for the same period. A higher dose of permethrin (300mg/kg body weight/day), for a shorter period (22 days), did not induce lymphocyte DNA damage, while supplementation with 200mg/kg of Vitamins E and C protected erythrocytes against plasma membrane lipids peroxidation. Moreover, treatment with Vitamins E and C maintained the activity of glutathione peroxidase, which was reduced in the presence of permethrin, and reduced the osmotic fragility, which had increased following permethrin treatment.},

In addition, the CAT levels decreased to the control level following their elevation during early exposure. High concentrations of imidacloprid (1.25 and 5 mg/L) induced excessive ROS production and markedly increased MDA content on the 21st day of exposure. DNA damage was dose- and time-dependent.

  abstract = {Over the past several years evidence has been accumulating from in vivo animal studies, observations in humans, and in vitro studies, that organophosphorus (OP) insecticides may induce oxidative stress. Such effects may contribute to some of the toxic manifestations of OPs, particularly upon chronic or developmental exposures. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of oxidative stress in the neurotoxicity of two commonly used OPs, chlorpyrifos (CPF) and diazinon (DZ), their oxygen analogs (CPO and DZO), and their “inactive” metabolites (TCP and IMP), in neuronal cells from a genetic model of glutathione deficiency. Cerebellar granule neurons from wild type mice (Gclm +/+) and mice lacking the modifier subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (Gclm −/−), the first and limiting step in the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), were utilized. The latter display very low levels of GSH and are more susceptible to the toxicity of agents that increase oxidative stress. CPO and DZO were the most cytotoxic compounds, followed by CPF and DZ, while TCP and IMP displayed lower toxicity. Toxicity was significantly higher (10- to 25-fold) in neurons from Gclm (−/−) mice, and was antagonized by various antioxidants. Depletion of GSH from Gclm (+/+) neurons significantly increased their sensitivity to OP toxicity. OPs increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation and in both cases the effects were greater in neurons from Gclm (−/−) mice. OPs did not alter intracellular levels of GSH, but significantly increased those of oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Cytotoxicity was not antagonized by cholinergic antagonists, but was decreased by the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM. These studies indicate that cytotoxicity of OPs involves generation of reactive oxygen species and is modulated by intracellular GSH, and suggest that it may involve disturbances in intracellular homeostasis of calcium.},

  abstract = {Pyrethroid pesticides are used preferably over organochlorines and organophosphates due to their high effectiveness, low toxicity to non-target organisms and easy biodegradibility. However, it is possible that during the pyrethroid metabolism, there is generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pyrethroids may produce oxidative stress in intoxicated rats. The present study was therefore, undertaken to determine pyrethroid-induced lipid peroxidation (LPO) and to show whether pyrethroid intoxication alters the antioxidant system in erythrocytes. A single dose of cypermethrin and/or fenvalerate (0.001\% LD50) was administered orally to rats and the animals were sacrificed at 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14 days of treatment. The results showed that lipid peroxidation (LPO) in erythrocytes increased within 3 days of pyrethroid treatment. The increased oxidative stress resulted in an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). The increase in reduced glutathione (GSH) content in erythrocytes may probably be an initial adaptive response to increased oxidative stress in pyrethroid intoxicated rats. Erythrocytes and serum acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was measured in pyrethroid-induced oxidative stress as it may mimic inhibition in target tissues such as muscle and brain. The inhibition in erythrocytes and serum AChE activity was partially relieved over a period of time indicating recovery from pyrethroid intoxication. The increase in erythrocyte LPO correlated with the inhibition in erythrocyte AChE activity and so erythrocyte AChE can be a marker enzyme in pyrethroid toxicity. The results show oxidative stress and alteration in antioxidant enzymes in erythrocytes of pyrethroid intoxicated rats.},

  abstract = {Malathion is an organophosphate pesticide that is known for its high toxicity to insects and low to moderate potency to humans and other mammals. Its toxicity has been associated with the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity, leading to the interference with the transmission of nerve impulse, accumulation of acetylcholine at synaptic junctions, and subsequent induction of adverse health effects including headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, and miosis. Oxidative stress (OS) has been reported as a possible mechanism of malathion toxicity in humans. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine the role of OS in malathion-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. To achieve this goal, MTT, lipid peroxidation, and single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assays were performed, respectively, to evaluate the levels of cell viability, malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and DNA damage in human liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Study results indicated that malathion is mitogenic at lower levels of exposure, and cytotoxic at higher levels of exposure. Upon 48 h of exposure, the average percentages of cell viability were 100\% ± 11\%, 117\% ± 15\%, 86\% ± 15\%, 35\% ± 9\%, and 27\% ± 7\% for 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mM, respectively. In the lipid peroxidation assay, the concentrations of MDA produced were 12.55 ± 0.16, 20.65 ± 0.27, 31.1 ± 0.40, 34.75 ± 0.45, and 15.1 ± 0.20 μM in 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mM malathion, respectively. The Comet assay showed a significant increase in DNA damage at the 24 mM malathion exposure. Taken together, our results indicate that malathion exposure at higher concentrations induces cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in HepG2 cells, and its toxicity may be mediated through OS as evidenced by a significant production of MDA, an end product of lipid peroxidation. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Male rats were divided into 4 groups: (i) received only olive oil (ii) treated with 64.0 mg/kg body weight prallethrin (1/10 LD50) in olive oil via oral route daily for 28 days, (iii) treated with 64.0 mg/kg body weight prallethrin (1/10 LD50) and EO (160\,μL/kg\,b.wt.) in olive oil and (iv) received EO (160\,μL/kg\,b.wt.) in olive oil via oral route twice daily for 28 days. Prallethrin treatment caused decrease in body weight gain and increase in relative liver weight. There was a significant increase in the activity of serum marker enzymes, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase. It caused increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and reduction in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione-S-transferase in liver. Consistent histological changes were found in the liver of prallethrin treatment. EO showed significant protection with the depletion of serum marker enzymes and replenishment of antioxidant status and brought all the values to near normal, indicating the protective effect of EO. We can conclude that prallethrin caused oxidative damage and liver injury in male rat and co-administration of EO attenuated the toxic effect of prallethrin. These results demonstrate that administration of EO may be useful, easy, and economical to protect human against pyrethroids toxic effects.},

Type I pyrethroids cause a type I poisoning syndrome or “T syndrome”, whereas type II pyrethroids induce a type II choreoathetosis syndrome, known as “CS syndrome”. The aim of the present work is to compare the effect of PERM and CY on erythrocyte plasma membrane fluidity of rats, treated orally for 60 days with low and high doses of these insecticides. The different modifications induced by pyrethroids on lipid peroxidation, osmotic fragility and the antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)) were measured. The data obtained show that PERM, which proved more permeable than CY, produced an increase of fluidity and polarity in the hydrophilic–hydrophobic region of the erythrocyte bilayer even at low doses. Also at high doses, filtering through the membrane more easily, the PERM influenced more markedly the intracellular enzymatic activity, compared with CY, reducing GPx activity and increasing SOD activity.

  abstract = {Organophosphate (OP) nerve agents exert their toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. The excessive stimulation of cholinergic receptors rapidly causes neuronal damage, seizures, death, and long-term neurological impairment in those that survive. Owing to the lethality of organophosphorus agents and the growing risk they pose, medical interventions that prevent OP toxicity and the delayed injury response are much needed. Studies have shown that oxidative stress occurs in models of subacute, acute, and chronic exposure to OP agents. Key findings of these studies include alterations in mitochondrial function and increased free radical–mediated injury, such as lipid peroxidation. This review focuses on the role of reactive oxygen species in OP neurotoxicity and its dependence on seizure activity. Understanding the sources, mechanisms, and pathological consequences of OP-induced oxidative stress can lead to the development of rational therapies for treating toxic exposures.},

  abstract = {Malathion is an insecticide of the group of organophosphate pesticides (OPs), which shows strong insecticidal effects. However, it possesses mutagenic and carcinogenic properties and shows organ-specific toxicity in relation to the heart, kidney and other vertebrate organs. The exact mechanism of the genotoxic effects of malathion is not yet known. Free radical damage is an important direct or indirect factor in several pathological and toxicological processes, including malathion poisoning. The aim of the present study was the evaluation of oxidative damage in different tissues of Wistar rats, administered intra peritoneally at doses of 25, 50, 100 and 150mgmalathion/kg, after acute and sub-chronic malathion exposure. Oxidative stress evaluation was based on lipid peroxidation by levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), protein oxidation by levels of carbonyl groups, and also on the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, two antioxidant enzymes that detoxity superoxide radical (O2−) and hydrogen peroxide, respectively. The results showed that the most sensitive targets of oxidative damage were kidney, lung and diaphragm after acute treatment, and liver, quadriceps and serum after sub-chronic treatment. Also, in general, increased lipid peroxidation measured as TBARS levels seems to be a better biomarker of oxidative stress compared to the contents of protein carbonyls after acute and sub-chronic malathion treatments. The present findings reinforce the concept that oxidative stress and particularly lipoperoxidation, are involved in OPs toxicity.},

They were evaluated for oxidative stress markers, including thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) indicator of lipid peroxidation (LPO), ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) indicator of total anti-oxidant capacity, total thiol (SH) groups and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels in blood and AChE activity in erythrocytes. The results show marked inhibition of AChE activity, increased TBARS, decreased FRAP and decreased thiol group levels in workers. The reduction in activity of AChE correlated well with increased TBARS and decreased FRAP in OP formulators. It is concluded that OP-formulating workers are exposed to more oxidative stress. The measurement of erythrocyte AChE activity in pesticide workers who formulate OPs can be a good monitoring factor and is recommended to be performed in a regular manner.},

Thus, dogma indicates that the target of OP pesticides is AChE, but many authors postulate that these compounds also disturb cellular redox processes, and change the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Interestingly, it has also been reported that oxidative stress plays also a role in the regulation and activity of AChE. The aims of this study were to determine the effects of the antioxidant, vitamin C (VC), the oxidant, t-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) and the organophosphate Chlorpyrifos (CPF), on AChE gene transcription and activity in zebrafish embryos after 72h exposure. In addition, oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring antioxidant enzymes activities and transcription, and quantification of total glutathione. Apical effects on the development of zebrafish embryos were also measured. With the exception of AChE inhibition and enhanced gene expression, limited effects of CPF on oxidative stress and apical endpoints were found at this developmental stage. Addition of VC had little effect on oxidative stress or AChE, but increased pericardial area and heartbeat rate through an unknown mechanism. TBOOH diminished AChE gene expression and activity, and caused oxidative stress when administered alone. However, in combination with CPF, only reductions in AChE activity were observed with no significant changes in oxidative stress suggesting the adverse apical endpoints in the embryos may have been due to AChE inhibition by CPF rather than oxidative stress. These results give additional evidence to support the role of prooxidants in AChE activity and expression.},

In this study, bovine peripheral lymphocytes were incubated with different concentrations of this formulation (10; 30; 60; 120 and 240 μg.mL−1) for 4 h to address the potential cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of the insecticide. Insecticide formulation treatment resulted in decreased cell viability and proliferation, p53-mediated cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and apoptosis induction accompanied by elevated levels of mitochondrial superoxide and protein carbonylation. Oxidant-based DNA damage and DNA damage response (DDR) were also observed, namely the formation of micronuclei, DNA double-strand breaks and slightly elevated recruitment of p53 binding protein (53BP1) foci. Our results contribute to the elucidation of insecticide effects on animal lymphocyte cultures after short-term exposure. Due to increased application of neonicotinoids worldwide, resulting in both higher yields and adverse effects on non-target animals and humans, further in vivo and in vitro experiments should be performed to confirm their cytotoxic and genotoxic activities during short-term exposure.},

  abstract = {Declining insect population sizes are provoking grave concern around the world as insects play essential roles in food production and ecosystems. Environmental contamination by intense insecticide usage is consistently proposed as a significant contributor, among other threats. Many studies have demonstrated impacts of low doses of insecticides on insect behavior, but have not elucidated links to insecticidal activity at the molecular and cellular levels. Here, the histological, physiological, and behavioral impacts of imidacloprid are investigated in Drosophila melanogaster, an experimental organism exposed to insecticides in the field. We show that oxidative stress is a key factor in the mode of action of this insecticide at low doses. Imidacloprid produces an enduring flux of Ca2+ into neurons and a rapid increase in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the larval brain. It affects mitochondrial function, energy levels, the lipid environment, and transcriptomic profiles. Use of RNAi to induce ROS production in the brain recapitulates insecticide-induced phenotypes in the metabolic tissues, indicating that a signal from neurons is responsible. Chronic low level exposures in adults lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, severe damage to glial cells, and impaired vision. The potent antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA), reduces the severity of a number of the imidacloprid-induced phenotypes, indicating a causal role for oxidative stress. Given that other insecticides are known to generate oxidative stress, this research has wider implications. The systemic impairment of several key biological functions, including vision, reported here would reduce the resilience of insects facing other environmental challenges.},

  abstract = {This review concentrates on advances in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) structure, function and inhibition made in the last seven years, during which time substantial advances have been made in our understanding of this enzyme family. There is now information on the enzyme structure at all levels from primary (amino acid sequence) to quaternary (dimerization, association with other proteins) structure. The crystal structures of the oxygenase domains of inducible NOS (iNOS) and vascular endothelial NOS (eNOS) allow us to interpret other information in the context of this important part of the enzyme, with its binding sites for iron protoporphyrin IX (haem), biopterin, L-arginine, and the many inhibitors which interact with them. The exact nature of the NOS reaction, its mechanism and its products continue to be sources of controversy. The role of the biopterin cofactor is now becoming clearer, with emerging data implicating one-electron redox cycling as well as the multiple allosteric effects on enzyme activity. Regulation of the NOSs has been described at all levels from gene transcription to covalent modification and allosteric regulation of the enzyme itself. A wide range of NOS inhibitors have been discussed, interacting with the enzyme in diverse ways in terms of site and mechanism of inhibition, time-dependence and selectivity for individual isoforms, although there are many pitfalls and misunderstandings of these aspects. Highly selective inhibitors of iNOS versus eNOS and neuronal NOS have been identified and some of these have potential in the treatment of a range of inflammatory and other conditions in which iNOS has been implicated.},

We addressed to what extent complex I, III and IV,respectively, should be inhibited to cause ROS generation. For inhibition of complex I, III and IV, rotenone, antimycin and cyanide were used, respectively, and ROS formation was followed by measuring the activity of aconitase enzyme. ROS formation was not detected until complex III was inhibited by up to 71 +/- 4\%, above that threshold inhibition, decrease in aconitase activity indicated an enhanced ROS generation. Similarly, threshold inhibition of complex IV caused an accelerated ROS production. By contrast, inactivation of complex I to a small extent (16 +/- 2\%) resulted in a significant increase in ROS formation, and no clear threshold inhibition could be determined. However, the magnitude of ROS generated at complex I when it is completely inhibited is smaller than that observed when complex III or complex IV was fully inactivated. Our findings may add a novel aspect to the pathology of Parkinson's disease, showing that a moderate level of complex I inhibition characteristic in Parkinson's disease leads to significant ROS formation. The amount of ROS generated by complex I inhibition is sufficient to inhibit in situ the activity of endogenous aconitase.},

  abstract = {The mitochondrion is at the core of cellular energy metabolism, being the site of most ATP generation. Calcium is a key regulator of mitochondrial function and acts at several levels within the organelle to stimulate ATP synthesis. However, the dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis is now recognized to play a key role in several pathologies. For example, mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ overload can lead to enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species, triggering of the permeability transition pore, and cytochrome c release, leading to apoptosis. Despite progress regarding the independent roles of both Ca2+ and mitochondrial dysfunction in disease, the molecular mechanisms by which Ca2+ can elicit mitochondrial dysfunction remain elusive. This review highlights the delicate balance between the positive and negative effects of Ca2+ and the signaling events that perturb this balance. Overall, a “two-hit” hypothesis is developed, in which Ca2+ plus another pathological stimulus can bring about mitochondrial dysfunction.},

  abstract = {One of the devastating effects of acute exposure to organophosphates, like nerve agents, is the induction of severe and prolonged status epilepticus (SE), which can cause death, or brain damage if death is prevented. Seizures after exposure are initiated by muscarinic receptor hyperstimulation—after inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by the organophosphorus agent and subsequent elevation of acetylcholine—but they are reinforced and sustained by glutamatergic hyperexcitation, which is the primary cause of brain damage. Diazepam is the FDA-approved anticonvulsant for the treatment of nerve agent-induced SE, and its replacement by midazolam is currently under consideration. However, clinical data derived from the treatment of SE of any etiology, as well as studies on the control of nerve agent-induced SE in animal models, have indicated that diazepam and midazolam control seizures only temporarily, their antiseizure efficacy is reduced as the latency of treatment from the onset of SE increases, and their neuroprotective efficacy is limited or absent. Here, we review data on the discovery of a novel anticonvulsant and neuroprotectant, LY293558, an AMPA/GluK1 receptor antagonist. Treatment of soman-exposed immature, young-adult, and aged rats with LY293558, terminates SE with limited recurrence of seizures, significantly protects from brain damage, and prevents long-term behavioral deficits, even when LY293558 is administered 1 h post-exposure. More beneficial effects and complete neuroprotection is obtained when LY293558 administration is combined with caramiphen, which antagonizes NMDA receptors. Further efficacy studies may bring the LY293558 + caramiphen combination therapy on the pathway to approval for human use.},

  abstract = {A pivotal role for excitotoxicity in neurodegenerative diseases is gaining increasingly more acceptance, but the underlying mechanisms through which it participates in neurodegeneration still need further investigation. Excessive activation of glutamate receptors by excitatory amino acids leads to a number of deleterious consequences, including impairment of calcium buffering, generation of free radicals, activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition and secondary excitotoxicity. Recent studies implicate excitotoxicity in a variety of neuropathological conditions, suggesting that neurodegenerative diseases with distinct genetic etiologies may share excitotoxicity as a common pathogenic pathway. Thus, understanding the pathways involved in excitotoxicity is of critical importance for the future clinical treatment of many neurodegenerative diseases. This review discusses the current understanding of excitotoxic mechanisms and how they are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.},

  abstract = {Calcium through NMDA receptors (NMDARs) is necessary for the long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength; however, NMDARs differ in several properties that can influence the amount of calcium influx into the spine. These properties, such as sensitivity to magnesium block and conductance decay kinetics, change the receptor's response to spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) protocols, and thereby shape synaptic integration and information processing. This study investigates the role of GluN2 subunit differences on spine calcium concentration during several STDP protocols in a model of a striatal medium spiny projection neuron (MSPN). The multi-compartment, multi-channel model exhibits firing frequency, spike width, and latency to first spike similar to current clamp data from mouse dorsal striatum MSPN. We find that NMDAR-mediated calcium is dependent on GluN2 subunit type, action potential timing, duration of somatic depolarization, and number of action potentials. Furthermore, the model demonstrates that in MSPNs, GluN2A and GluN2B control which STDP intervals allow for substantial calcium elevation in spines. The model predicts that blocking GluN2B subunits would modulate the range of intervals that cause long term potentiation. We confirmed this prediction experimentally, demonstrating that blocking GluN2B in the striatum, narrows the range of STDP intervals that cause long term potentiation. This ability of the GluN2 subunit to modulate the shape of the STDP curve could underlie the role that GluN2 subunits play in learning and development.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) participate in NMDA receptor signaling. However, the source(s) of the ROS and their role in the increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) induced by NMDA receptor activation have not been firmly established. NADPH oxidase generates ROS in neurons, but there is no direct evidence that this enzyme is present in neurons containing NMDA receptors, or that is involved in NMDA receptor-dependent ROS production and CBF increase. We addressed these questions using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches. We found that the CBF and ROS increases elicited by topical application of NMDA to the mouse neocortex were both dependent on neuronal NO synthase (nNOS), cGMP, and the cGMP effector kinase protein kinase G (PKG). In mice lacking the NADPH oxidase subunit NOX2, the ROS increase was not observed, but the CBF increase was still present. Electron microscopy of the neocortex revealed NOX2 immunolabeling in postsynaptic somata and dendrites that also expressed the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit and nNOS. In neuronal cultures, the NMDA-induced increase in ROS was mediated by NADPH oxidase through NO, cGMP and PKG. We conclude that NADPH oxidase in postsynaptic neurons generates ROS during NMDA receptor activation. However, NMDA receptor-derived ROS do not contribute to the CBF increase. The findings establish a NOX2-containing NADPH oxidase as a major source of ROS produced by NMDA receptor activation, and identify NO as the critical link between NMDA receptor activity and NOX2-dependent ROS production.},

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that cholinergic input to the hippocampus plays an important role in learning and memory and that degeneration of cholinergic terminals in the hippocampus may contribute to the memory loss associated with Alzheimer’s disease. One of the more prominent effects of cholinergic agonists on hippocampal physiology is the potentiation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor currents by muscarinic agonists. Here, we employ traditional pharmacological reagents as well as m1-toxin, an m1 antagonist with unprecedented selectivity, to demonstrate that this potentiation of NMDA-receptor currents in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells is mediated by the genetically defined m1 muscarinic receptor. Furthermore, we demonstrate the colocalization of the m1 muscarinic receptor and the NR1a NMDA receptor subunit at the electron microscopic level, indicating a spatial relationship that would allow for physiological interactions between these two receptors. This work demonstrates that the m1-muscarinic receptor gene product modulates excitatory synaptic transmission, and it has important implications in the study of learning and memory as well as the design of drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s.},

  abstract = {Organophosphates (OPs) and carbamates are widely used insecticides that exert their neurotoxicity via inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and subsequent overexcitation. OPs can induce additional neurotoxic effects at concentrations below those for inhibition of AChE, indicating other mechanisms of action are also involved. Since tight regulation of the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) is essential for proper neuronal development and function, effects of one carbamate (carbaryl) and two OPs (chlorpyrifos, parathion-ethyl) as well as their -oxon metabolites on [Ca2+]i were investigated. Effects of acute (20min) exposure to (mixtures of) insecticides on basal and depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i were measured in fura-2-loaded PC12 cells using single-cell fluorescence microscopy. Acute exposure to chlorpyrifos and its metabolite chlorpyrifos-oxon (10μM) induced a modest increase in basal [Ca2+]i. More importantly, the tested OPs concentration-dependently inhibited depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i. Chlorpyrifos already induced a ∼30\% inhibition at 0.1μM and a 100\% inhibition at 10μM (IC50=0.43μM), whereas parathion-ethyl inhibited the depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i increase with ∼70\% at 10μM. Interestingly, -oxon metabolites were more potent inhibitors of AChE, but were less potent inhibitors of depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i compared to their parent compound (chlorpyrifos-oxon) or were even without effect (paraoxon-ethyl and -methyl). Similarly, acute exposure to carbaryl had no effect on [Ca2+]i. Exposure to mixtures of chlorpyrifos with its oxon-analog or with parathion-ethyl did not increase the degree of inhibition, indicating additivity does not apply. These data demonstrate that concentration-dependent inhibition of depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i is a novel mechanism of action of (sub)micromolar concentrations of OPs that could partly underlie OP-induced neurotoxicity.},

  abstract = {The present study elucidates a possible mechanism by which chronic organophosphate exposure (dichlorvos 6mg/kgbw, s.c. for 12 weeks) causes neuronal degeneration. Mitochondria, as a primary site of cellular energy generation and oxygen consumption represent itself a likely target for organophosphate poisoning. Therefore, the objective of the current study was planned with an aim to investigate the effect of chronic dichlorvos exposure on mitochondrial calcium uptake, oxidative stress generation and its implication in the induction of neuronal apoptosis in rodent model. Mitochondrial preparation from dichlorvos (DDVP) treated rat brain demonstrated significant increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (644.2nmol/mg protein). Our results indicated decreased mitochondrial electron transfer activities of cytochrome oxidase (complex IV) along with altered mitochondrial complex I, and complex II activity, which might have resulted from elevated mitochondrial calcium uptake. The alterations in the mitochondrial calcium uptake and mitochondrial electron transfer enzyme activities in turn might have caused an increase in malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl and 8-hydoxydeoxyguanosine formation as a result of enhanced lipid peroxidation, and as well as protein and mtDNA oxidation. All this could have been because of enhanced oxidative stress, decreased GSH levels and also decreased Mn-SOD activity in the mitochondria isolated from dichlorvos treated rat brain. Thus, chronic organophosphate exposure has the potential to disrupt cellular antioxidant defense system which in turn triggers the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol as well as caspase-3 activation in dichlorvos treated rat brain as revealed by immunoblotting experiments. Low-level long-term organophosphate exposure finally resulted in oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis. These studies provide an evidence of impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and apoptotic neuronal degeneration after chronic low-level exposure to dichlorvos.},

  abstract = {The classical studies of nicotine by Langley at the turn of the 20th century introduced the concept of a “receptive substance,” from which the idea of a “receptor” came to light. Subsequent studies aided by the Torpedo electric organ, a rich source of muscle-type nicotinic receptors (nAChRs), and the discovery of α-bungarotoxin, a snake toxin that binds pseudo-irreversibly to the muscle nAChR, resulted in the muscle nAChR being the best characterized ligand-gated ion channel hitherto. With the advancement of functional and genetic studies in the late 1980s, the existence of nAChRs in the mammalian brain was confirmed and the realization that the numerous nAChR subtypes contribute to the psychoactive properties of nicotine and other drugs of abuse and to the neuropathology of various diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and schizophrenia, has since emerged. This review provides a comprehensive overview of these findings and the more recent revelations of the impact that the rich diversity in function and expression of this receptor family has on neuronal and nonneuronal cells throughout the body. Despite these numerous developments, our understanding of the contributions of specific neuronal nAChR subtypes to the many facets of physiology throughout the body remains in its infancy.},

Histochemical labelling was blocked by the enzyme inhibitors eserine and BW284c51, but not by iso-OMPA, showing that the staining reflected true AChE activity. The majority of staining was localized on the cell surface but granular intracellular staining was also visible in many cell bodies. In both species, the cellular expression of AChE followed a similar but complex spatiotemporal staining pattern. Initially, mainly epidermal tissue structures were stained in the various body appendages (stages 25\%–30\%). Labelling subsequently appeared in outgrowing neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) and in the nerves innervating the limbs and dorsal body wall (stages 30\%–40\%). The latter staining originated in motoneurons of the ventral nerve cord. In a third phase (after 45\%), the somata of certain identified mechanosensory neurons started to express AChE activity, presumably reflecting cholinergic differentiation. Staining was also found in repo-positive glial cells of the CNS, longitudinal glia of connectives, glia of the stomatogastric nervous system and glial cells ensheathing peripheral nerves. Glial cells remained AChE-positive during larval to adult development, whereas motoneurons lost their AChE expression. The expression pattern in non-neuronal cells and glutamatergic motoneurons and the developmental appearance of AChE prior to synaptogenesis in the CNS suggest non-cholinergic functions of AChE during grasshopper embryogenesis.},

  abstract = {Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme whose best-known function is to hydrolyze the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholinesterase is expressed in several noncholinergic tissues. Accordingly, we report for the first time the identification of acetylcholinesterase in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells. Here we further performed an electrophoretic and biochemical characterization of this enzyme, using protein extracts obtained by solubilization of human endothelial cell membranes with Triton X-100. These extracts were analyzed under polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of Triton X-100 and under nondenaturing conditions, followed by specific staining for cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase activity. The gels revealed one enzymatically active acetylcholinesterase band in the extracts that disappeared when staining was performed in the presence of eserine (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor). Performing western blotting with the C-terminal anti-acetylcholinesterase IgG, we identified a single protein band of approximately 70 kDa, the molecular mass characteristic of the human monomeric form of acetylcholinesterase. The western blotting with the N-terminal anti-acetylcholinesterase IgG antibody revealed a double band around 66–70 kDa. Using the Ellman's method to measure the cholinesterase activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, regarding its substrate specificity, we confirmed the existence of an acetylcholinesterase enzyme. Our studies revealed a predominance of acetylcholinesterase over other cholinesterases in human endothelial cells. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the existence of a membrane-bound acetylcholinesterase in human endothelial cells. In future studies, we will investigate the role of this protein in the endothelial vascular system.},

Here, we provide evidence that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a novel osteoblast-derived mediator of cell-matrix interactions in bone. These findings complement an increasing body of evidence which suggests that AChE, in addition to its role in terminating cholinergic signaling, may be instrumental in regulating cellular differentiation and adhesion. We have shown, using RT-PCR, that osteosarcoma cell lines and primary cultures of osteoblasts express AChE mRNA. Expression appeared to be differentiation-dependent, and restricted to AChE splice variants containing the T subunit (exon 6). Immunofluorescent localization demonstrated that these osteoblastic cells expressed protein for AChE with an intracellular vesicular distribution. Immunohistochemistry on tissue sections confirmed AChE expression by osteoblasts in vivo, and revealed the presence of AChE along cement lines, also identified by enzyme histochemistry. In vitro functional studies indicated that osteoblast-like cells adhered specifically to and spread on AChE substrates, but did not interact with butyrylcholinesterase, a closely related protein. Our evidence strongly implicates AChE as a novel bone matrix protein, capable of mediating cell-matrix interactions, and as such may be a principal participant in organized bone formation and the regulation of remodeling.},

  abstract = {Apart from its catalytic function in hydrolyzing acetylcholine, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) affects cell proliferation, differentiation and responses to various insults, including stress. These responses are at least in part specific to the three C-terminal variants of AChE which are produced by alternative splicing of the single ACHE gene. ‘Synaptic’ AChE-S constitutes the principal multimeric enzyme in brain and muscle; soluble, monomeric ‘readthrough’ AChE-R appears in embryonic and tumor cells and is induced under psychological, chemical and physical stress; and glypiated dimers of erythrocytic AChE-E associate with red blood cell membranes. We postulate that the homology of AChE to the cell adhesion proteins, gliotactin, glutactin and the neurexins, which have more established functions in nervous system development, is the basis of its morphogenic functions. Competition between AChE variants and their homologs on interactions with the corresponding protein partners would inevitably modify cellular signaling. This can explain why AChE-S exerts process extension from cultured amphibian, avian and mammalian glia and neurons in a manner that is C-terminus-dependent, refractory to several active site inhibitors and, in certain cases, redundant to the function of AChE-like proteins. Structural functions of AChE variants can explain their proliferative and developmental roles in blood, bone, retinal and neuronal cells. Moreover, the association of AChE excess with amyloid plaques in the degenerating human brain and with progressive cognitive and neuromotor deficiencies observed in AChE-transgenic animal models most likely reflects the combined contributions of catalytic and structural roles.},

  abstract = {Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme catalyzing the degradation of acetylcholine, plays an important suppressive role in the cholinergic regulation by terminating the action of acetylcholine. The expression of acetylcholinesterase and other cholinergic components is not restricted to only brain and nerve tissues but can also be found in non-neuronal tissues like the immune system and bone tissue. Primary identification of these components has been achieved. However, the information about their specific functions and underlying molecular mechanisms in bone remains scattered. Here, the physiological process of bone development, homeostasis, and degeneration are introduced. Next, the cholinergic system and its expression in bone tissue is documented. Among them, special attention goes to AChE, as the structure of this enzyme suggests diverse binding affinities, enabled by a peripheral site and a catalytic site. The peripheral site supports the non-enzymatic function of AChE in non-neuronal systems. Based on recent studies, the non-neuronal roles of acetylcholinesterase, both enzymatically and non-enzymatically, in bone development, homeostasis and degeneration are summarized briefly together with potential mechanisms to support these functions. We conclude that AChE may be a potential therapeutic target for bone diseases like osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is crucial for degrading acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. In vitro studies suggest that, in addition to its role in nervous system signaling, AChE can also modulate non-neuronal cell properties, although it remains controversial whether AChE functions in this capacity in vivo. Here, we show that AChE plays an essential non-classical role in vertebrate gut morphogenesis. Exposure of Xenopus embryos to AChE-inhibiting chemicals results in severe defects in intestinal development. Tissue-targeted loss-of-function assays (via microinjection of antisense morpholino or CRISPR-Cas9) confirm that AChE is specifically required in the gut endoderm tissue, a non-neuronal cell population, where it mediates adhesion to fibronectin and regulates cell rearrangement events that drive gut lengthening and digestive epithelial morphogenesis. Notably, the classical esterase activity of AChE is dispensable for this activity. As AChE is deeply conserved, widely expressed outside of the nervous system, and the target of many environmental chemicals, these results have wide-reaching implications for development and toxicology., Highlighted article: A non-classical function of acetylcholinesterase in the polarization, rearrangement and adhesion of endoderm cells during Xenopus gut morphogenesis is identified.},

  abstract = {The discovery of the first neurotransmitter — acetylcholine — was soon followed by the discovery of its hydrolysing enzyme, acetylcholinesterase. The role of acetylcholinesterase in terminating acetylcholine-mediated neurotransmission made it the focus of intense research for much of the past century. But the complexity of acetylcholinesterase gene regulation and recent evidence for some of the long-suspected 'non-classical' actions of this enzyme have more recently driven a profound revolution in acetylcholinesterase research. Although our understanding of the additional roles of acetylcholinesterase is incomplete, the time is ripe to summarize the evidence on a remarkable diversity of acetylcholinesterase functions.},

  abstract = {Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression is regulated in cell types at the transcriptional and translational levels. In this study, we characterized and compared AChE catalytic activity, mRNA, protein expression, and protein localization in a variety of neuronal (SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and primary cerebellar granule neurons (CGN)) and non-neuronal (LLC-MK2, HeLa, THP-1, and primary astrocytes) cell types. All cell lines expressed AChE catalytic activity; however the levels of AChE-specific activity were higher in neuronal cells than in the non-neuronal cell types. CGN expressed significantly more AChE activity than SH-SY5Y cells. All cell lines analyzed expressed AChE protein at equivalent levels, as well as mRNA splice variants. Localization of AChE was characterized by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. SH-SY5Y, CGN, and nerve-growth factor-differentiated PC-12 cells exhibited a pattern of AChE localization characterized as diffuse in the cytoplasm and punctate staining along neurites and on the plasma membrane. The localization in HeLa, LLC-MK2, fibroblasts, and undifferentiated PC-12 cells was significantly different than in neuronal cells—AChE was intensely localized in the perinuclear region, without staining near or on the plasma membrane. Based on the evidence presented here, we hypothesize that the presence of AChE protein doesn't correlate with catalytic activity, and the diffuse cytoplasmic and plasma membrane localization of AChE is a property of neuronal cell types. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

AChE is also found in tissues devoid of cholinergic responses, indicating potential functions beyond neurotransmission. It has been suggested that AChE may participate in development, differentiation, and pathogenic processes such as Alzheimer's disease and tumorigenesis. We examined AChE expression in a number of cell lines upon induction of apoptosis by various stimuli. AChE is induced in all apoptotic cells examined as determined by cytochemical staining, immunological analysis, affinity chromatography purification, and molecular cloning. The AChE protein was found in the cytoplasm at the initiation of apoptosis and then in the nucleus or apoptotic bodies upon commitment to cell death. Sequence analysis revealed that AChE expressed in apoptotic cells is identical to the synapse type AChE. Pharmacological inhibitors of AChE prevented apoptosis. Furthermore, blocking the expression of AChE with antisense inhibited apoptosis. Therefore, our studies demonstrate that AChE is potentially a marker and a regulator of apoptosis.},

Intriguingly, the long-lived mutants, ranging from yeast to mice, share some important phenotypic characteristics, including reduced insulin signaling, enhanced sensitivity to insulin, and reduced IGF-I plasma levels. Such genetic homologies and phenotypic similarities between insulin/IGF-I pathway mutants raise the possibility that the fundamental mechanism of aging may be evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. Very recent findings also provide novel and intriguing evidence for the involvement of insulin and IGF-I in the control of aging and longevity in humans. In this study, we focus on how the insulin/IGF-I pathway controls yeast, nematode, fruit fly, and rodent life spans and how it is related to the aging process in humans to outline the prospect of a unifying mechanism in the genetics of longevity.},

Work done in a variety of model systems, continues to contribute to our current understanding of this TOR signalling network. Recent studies in flies and mammalian tissue culture cells have elucidated many signalling components upstream of TOR complex 1. These studies also suggest that aberrant mammalian TOR complex 1 signalling contributes to a number of pathologies ranging from metabolic diseases to hyperproliferative disorders and cancers.

All the mentioned pathways can be used as model systems for the study of homologous pathways in human cells and a failure in these pathways is directly linked to several human diseases such as the metabolic syndrome and neurodegeneration.

Nearly half (47\%) of the yeast genes could be successfully humanized. Sequence similarity and expression only partly predicted replaceability. Instead, replaceability depended strongly on gene modules: genes in the same process tended to be similarly replaceable (e.g., sterol biosynthesis) or not (e.g., DNA replication initiation). Simulations confirmed selection for specific function can maintain replaceability despite extensive sequence divergence. Critical ancestral functions of many essential genes are thus retained in a pathway-specific manner, robust to drift in sequences, splicing, and protein interfaces.},

  abstract = {Despite over a billion years of evolutionary divergence, several thousand human genes possess clearly identifiable orthologs in yeast, and many have undergone lineage-specific duplications in one or both lineages. These duplicated genes may have been free to diverge in function since their expansion, and it is unclear how or at what rate ancestral functions are retained or partitioned among co-orthologs between species and within gene families. Thus, in order to investigate how ancestral functions are retained or lost post-duplication, we systematically replaced hundreds of essential yeast genes with their human orthologs from gene families that have undergone lineage-specific duplications, including those with single duplications (1 yeast gene to 2 human genes, 1:2) or higher-order expansions (1:{$>$}2) in the human lineage. We observe a variable pattern of replaceability across different ortholog classes, with an obvious trend toward differential replaceability inside gene families, and rarely observe replaceability by all members of a family. We quantify the ability of various properties of the orthologs to predict replaceability, showing that in the case of 1:2 orthologs, replaceability is predicted largely by the divergence and tissue-specific expression of the human co-orthologs, i.e., the human proteins that are less diverged from their yeast counterpart and more ubiquitously expressed across human tissues more often replace their single yeast ortholog. These trends were consistent with in silico simulations demonstrating that when only one ortholog can replace its corresponding yeast equivalent, it tends to be the least diverged of the pair. Replaceability of yeast genes having more than 2 human co-orthologs was marked by retention of orthologous interactions in functional or protein networks as well as by more ancestral subcellular localization. Overall, we performed {$>$}400 human gene replaceability assays, revealing 50 new human–yeast complementation pairs, thus opening up avenues to further functionally characterize these human genes in a simplified organismal context.},

A RNA molecule of 3.5 kilobases was identified as the PDR1 transcript. The nucleotide sequence of the complementing DNA fragment contained a 3192-nucleotide open reading frame. Disruption of the pdr1 and PDR1 genes restored or increased drug sensitivity. Analysis of the PDR1 deduced amino acid sequence revealed several homologies to four different regulatory proteins involved in the control of gene expression, including a cysteine-rich motif suggested to be a metal-binding domain for DNA recognition. A model is proposed of a general transcriptional control by PDR1 of several target genes encoding proteins from plasma, mitochondria, and possibly other permeability barriers.},

  abstract = {TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae PDR3 gene, located near the centromere of chromosome II, has been completely sequenced and characterised. Mutationspdr3-1 andpdr3-2, which confer resistance to several antibiotics can be complemented by a wild-type allele of the PDR3 gene. The sequence of the wild-typePDR3 gene revealed the presence of a long open reading frame capable of encoding a 976-amino acid protein. The protein contains a single Zn(II)2Cys6 binuclear-type zinc finger homologous to the DNA-binding motifs of other transcriptional activators from lower eukaryotes. Evidence that the PDR3 protein is a transcriptional activator was provided by demonstrating that DNA-bound LexA-PDR3 fusion proteins stimulate expression of a nearby promoter containing LexA binding sites. The use of LexA-PDR3 fusions revealed that the protein contains two activation domains, one localised near the N-terminal, cysteine-rich domain and the other localised at the C-terminus. The salient feature of the PDR3 protein is its similarity to the protein coded byPDR1, a gene responsible forpleiotropicdrugresistance. The two proteins show 36\% amino acid identity over their entire length and their zinc finger DNA-binding domains are highly conserved. The fact that the absence of both PDR1 and PDR3 (simultaneous disruption of the two genes) enhances multidrug sensitivity strongly suggests that the two transcriptional factors have closely related functions.},

  abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells possess the ability to simultaneously acquire resistance to an array of drugs with different cytotoxic activities. The genes involved in this acquisition are referred to as pleiotropic drug resistant (PDR) genes. Several semidominant, drug resistance-encoding PDR mutations have been found that map near the centromere on chromosome II, including PDR3-1 and PDR4-1. DNA sequencing of chromosome II identified a potential open reading frame, designated YBL03-23, that has the potential to encode a protein with strong sequence similarity to the product of the PDR1 gene, a zinc finger-containing transcription factor. Here we show that YBL03-23 is allelic with PDR3. The presence of a functional copy of either PDR1 or PDR3 is essential for drug resistance and expression of a putative membrane transporter-encoding gene, PDR5. Deletion mapping of the PDR5 promoter identified a region from -360 to -112 that is essential for expression of this gene. DNase I footprinting analysis using bacterially expressed Pdr3p showed specific recognition by this protein of at least one site in the -360/-112 interval in the PDR5 promoter. A high-copy-number plasmid carrying the PDR3 gene elevated resistance to both oligomycin and cycloheximide. Increasing the number of PDR3 gene copies in a delta pdr5 strain increased oligomycin resistance but was not able to correct the cycloheximide hypersensitivity that results from loss of PDR5. These data are consistent with the notion that PDR3 acts to increase cycloheximide resistance by elevating the level of PDR5 transcription, while PDR3-mediated oligomycin resistance acts through some other target gene.},

Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that Pdr1p and Pdr3p recognize so-called pleiotropic drug resistance elements (PDREs) in the promoters of target genes. In this study, we show that both Pdr1p and Pdr3p are phosphoproteins; Pdr3p isoforms migrate as two bands in gel electrophoresis, reflecting two distinct phosphorylation states. Most importantly, native co-immunoprecipitation experiments, using functional epitope-tagged Pdr1p/Pdr3p variants, demonstrate that Pdr1p and Pdr3p can form both homo- and heterodimers in vivo. Furthermore, in vivo footprinting of PDRE-containing promoters demonstrate that Pdr1p/Pdr3p constitutively occupy both perfect and degenerate PDREs in vivo. Thus, in addition to interaction with other regulators, differential dimerization provides a plausible explanation for the observation that Pdr3p and Pdr1p can both positively and negatively control PDR promoters with different combinations of perfect and degenerate PDREs.},

Yeast has only a slightly greater genetic complexity than bacteria and shares many of the technical advantages that permitted rapid progress in the molecular genetics of prokaryotes and their viruses. Some of the properties that make yeast particularly suitable for biological studies include rapid growth, dispersed cells, the ease of replica plating and mutant isolation, a well-defined genetic system, and most important, a highly versatile DNA transformation system. Being nonpathogenic, yeast can be handled with little precautions. Large quantities of normal baker's yeast are commercially available and can provide a cheap source for biochemical studies. The development of DNA transformation has made yeast particularly accessible to gene cloning and genetic engineering techniques. Structural genes corresponding to virtually any genetic trait can be identified by complementation from plasmid libraries. Plasmids can be introduced into yeast cells either as replicating molecules or by integration into the genome. In contrast to most other organisms, integrative recombination of transforming DNA in yeast proceeds exclusively via homologous recombination. Cloned yeast sequences, accompanied by foreign sequences on plasmids, can therefore be directed at will to specific locations in the genome.},

When done appropriately, independent replication of the entity–intervention pair contributes to the sample size (N) and forms the basis of statistical inference. If the wrong entity–intervention pair is chosen, an experiment cannot address the question of interest. We surveyed a random sample of published animal experiments from 2011 to 2016 where interventions were applied to parents and effects examined in the offspring, as regulatory authorities provide clear guidelines on replication with such designs. We found that only 22\% of studies (95\% CI = 17\%–29\%) replicated the correct entity–intervention pair and thus made valid statistical inferences. Nearly half of the studies (46\%, 95\% CI = 38\%–53\%) had pseudoreplication while 32\% (95\% CI = 26\%–39\%) provided insufficient information to make a judgement. Pseudoreplication artificially inflates the sample size, and thus the evidence for a scientific claim, resulting in false positives. We argue that distinguishing between biological units, experimental units, and observational units clarifies where replication should occur, describe the criteria for genuine replication, and provide concrete examples of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experimental designs.},

  abstract = {Hypothesis-based no-effect-concentration (NOEC) and regression-based x\% effect concentration (ECx) values are common statistical approaches used to summarize ecotoxicological effects. Controversy over the NOEC model has prompted a movement toward discontinuation of the NOEC in favor of ECx, but the best x\% effect surrogate for NOEC has not yet been determined. Historically, 10\% and 20\% effect concentrations (EC10 and EC20) have been treated as NOEC analogs. Given these measurements' importance to ecotoxicology, further understanding of the relationships between NOEC and EC10 or EC20 is crucial. In the present study, a metadataset of daphnid chronic toxicity tests was compiled to analyze the strength and significance of NOEC:EC10 and NOEC:EC20 relationships. The impact of endpoint (e.g., mortality, reproduction) and test condition parameters (e.g., pH, temperature) on NOEC:EC10 and NOEC:EC20 was evaluated. Mortality endpoints were most sensitive 51\% of the time, with growth and reproductive endpoints constituting the remainder, underscoring the value of using multiple endpoints to evaluate toxic effects rather than relying on reproduction as the a priori most sensitive endpoint. When test condition parameters were less restricted (e.g., pH, hardness), the NOEC:EC20 association was more robust, suggesting that variability introduced by test implementation increased variability in ECx calculation. The analysis revealed that, overall, EC10 was a more suitable analog than EC20 for NOEC. Recommendations include refinement and reporting of the test parameters pH and hardness to minimize variability in ECx calculation. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:2378–2384. © 2015 SETAC},

  abstract = {The relative ability of the NOEC (no-observed-effect concentration) and ECx (the effect concentration corresponding to x-percent response) to determine benchmark toxicant concentrations, which are expected to ensure environmental safety, when there are large uncertainties in data was investigated with Monte Carlo simulations. We assumed a hypothetical true concentration-response function, and examined how random fluctuations of responses around the true responses affected the NOEC and ECx values. For assessment of the relative performances of these endpoints, we adopted two criteria: how large uncertainties were allowed for the minimum requirement for safety to be met, and the probability with which the estimated endpoints exceeded the minimum requirement for safety. The results of simulations indicated that, when there were small uncertainties in the data, performance of the NOEC was comparable with or slightly better than the ECx (EC5 and EC10) in providing benchmark concentrations that satisfied the minimum requirement for safety. With larger random variation of data (the coefficient of variation in responses between replicates within treatments or in the control was noticeably larger than 10 percent), the NOEC performed considerably worse than the ECx in terms of the frequency of simulated runs in which the endpoints exceeded the minimum requirement of safety. We conclude that the NOEC is as relevant as the ECx for risk assessment of chemicals under limited situations.},

  abstract = {Dye exclusion tests are used to determine the number of live and dead cells. These assays are based on the principle that intact plasma membranes in live cells exclude specific dyes, whereas dead cells do not. Although widely used, the trypan blue (TB) exclusion assay has limitations. The dye can be incorporated by live cells after a short exposure time, and personal reliability, related to the expertise of the analyst, can affect the results. We propose an alternative assay for evaluating cell viability that combines the TB exclusion test and the high sensitivity of the flow cytometry technique. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of TB to emit fluorescence when complexed with proteins. According to our results, TB/bovine serum albumin and TB/cytoplasmic protein complexes emit fluorescence at 660 nm, which is detectable by flow cytometry using a 650-nm low-pass band filter. TB at 0.002\% (w/v) was defined as the optimum concentration for distinguishing unstained living cells from fluorescent dead cells, and fluorescence emission was stable for 30 min after cell treatment. Although previous studies have shown that TB promotes green fluorescence quenching, TB at 0.002\% did not interfere with green fluorescence in human live T-cells stained with anti-CD3/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) monoclonal antibody. We observed a high correlation between the percentage of propidium iodide+CD3/FITC+ and TB+CD3/FITC+ cells, as well as similar double-stained cell profiles in flow cytometry dot-plot graphs. Taken together, the results indicate that a TB exclusion assay by flow cytometry can be employed as an alternative tool for quick and reliable cell viability analysis.},

The cell wall structure is dynamic and can adapt to different physiological states or environmental conditions. For the investigation of morphological changes, selective staining with fluorescent dyes is a valuable tool. Furthermore, cell wall staining is used to facilitate sub-cellular localization experiments with fluorescently-labeled proteins and the detection of yeast cells in non-fungal host tissues. Here, we report staining of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall with Trypan Blue, which emits strong red fluorescence upon binding to chitin and yeast glucan; thereby, it facilitates cell wall analysis by confocal and super-resolution microscopy. The staining pattern of Trypan Blue was similar to that of the widely used UV-excitable, blue fluorescent cell wall stain Calcofluor White. Trypan Blue staining facilitated quantification of cell size and cell wall volume when utilizing the optical sectioning capacity of a confocal microscope. This enabled the quantification of morphological changes during growth under anaerobic conditions and in the presence of chemicals, demonstrating the potential of this approach for morphological investigations or screening assays.},

Thiacloprid belongs to a group of neonicotinoid insecticides. It shows a cytotoxic/cytostatic effect in human peripheral blood lymphocytes probably due to DNA damage. The use of thiacloprid is increasingly widespread worldwide, therefore is very important the assessment of its possible genotoxic and cytotoxic effects on a living organism. That is the reason why we studied the thiacloprid influence on the structure and stability of DNA in presented work. We have been studied the thiacloprid interaction with calf thymus DNA. Association constant was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy using equilibrium receptor-ligand binding analysis. The thermal denaturation of DNA was used to identify the mode of interaction. Viscosity changes were recorded to confirm/disconfirm the intercalation mode of interaction. Given the results, we can conclude that neonicotinoid pesticide thiacloprid destabilizes DNA. It changes the structure and stability of DNA through binding into the minor groove by hydrophobic or hydrogen interactions.},

  abstract = {Malathion [S-(1,2-dicarboethoxyethyl)O,O-dimethyl phosphorodithioate] is a commonly used organophosphorus insecticide reported to be genotoxic both in vivo and in vitro, but the reports are conflicting. In order to elucidate the genotoxic potency of the main compounds present in commercial preparations of malathion, the DNA-damaging effect of this insecticide, its major metabolite malaoxon [S-(1,2-dicarboethoxyethyl)O,O-dimethyl phosphorothiolate] and its isomer isomalathion [S-(1,2-dicarboethoxyethyl)O,S-dimethyl phosphorodithioate], all at purity of at least 99.8\%, was investigated by use of the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Freshly isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes were incubated with 25, 75 and 200 μM of the chemicals for 1 h at 37°C. The concentrations used are comparable to those found in blood following various non-lethal human exposures to pesticides. Malathion did not cause any significant changes in the comet length of the lymphocytes, throughout the range of concentrations tested. Malaoxon and isomalathion introduced damage to DNA in a dose-dependent manner. The effect induced by malaoxon was more pronounced than that caused by isomalathion. Treated cells were able to recover within a 60-min incubation in insecticide-free medium at 37°C except the lymphocytes exposed to malaoxon at 200 μM, which did not show measurable DNA repair. The latter result suggests a considerable cytotoxic effect (cell death) of malaoxon at the highest concentration used. The reported genotoxicity of malathion might, therefore, be a consequence of its metabolic biotransformation to malaoxon or the presence of malaoxon and/or isomalathion as well as other unspecified impurities in commercial formulations of malathion. In this regard, the results of our study clearly indicate that malathion used as commercial product, i.e., containing malaoxon and isomalathion, can be considered as a genotoxic substance in vitro. This means that it may also produce DNA disturbances in vivo, such as DNA breakage at sites of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, thus playing a role in the induction of malignancies in individuals exposed to this agent. Therefore, malathion can be regarded as a potential mutagen/carcinogen and requires further investigation.},

  abstract = {Recent studies showed that organophosphorus pesticides can increase incidence of metabolic disorders and diabetes. Considering the importance of pancreas in regulating blood glucose, the effect of malathion on essential elements of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in in vitro and in vivo conditions were evaluated. After dividing of rats into control and treatment groups, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was examined and then kinetic of glucose as well as pancreatic response to raise blood glucose were evaluated. After isolation of islets from pancreas, its function as well as oxidative stress markers and essential elements of GSIS were examined. Malathion at dose of 400mg/kg impaired GTT and increased AUC0–180min (P=0.047) and T1/2β of glucose (P=0.0016), and reduced insulin response (P=0.005) 30min after oral administering of glucose. In addition to impaired glucose tolerance, there were significant increases in lipid peroxidation (P{$<$}0.001), carbonyl groups (P=0.007) and 8-deoxyguanosine (P=0.011) as the biomarkers of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage to lipid, protein and DNA, respectively in islets. In static condition, a remarkable decrease was observed in ratio of insulin release/mM glucose (P{$<$}0.001) and a dramatic increase was seen in ROS formation at all glucose levels. Malathion only reduced ATP/ADP ratio in stimulating concentrations of glucose. Despite the dramatic reduction of glucokinase (GCK) mRNA expression (P=0.004), the expression of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) (P=0.01) was increased significantly. Conclusion Dysfunction of glucose metabolism and impairment of insulin secretion are associated with a depletion of energy and induction of oxidative stress following acute exposure to malathion.},

  abstract = {Deltamethrin and thiachloprid are an α-cyano class pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticide, respectively. Recently, a pesticide combining deltamethrin and thiacloprid has also been released. In the present study, the acute and subacute toxic effects of deltamethrin, thiachlopride, and a combination of these insecticides, on the lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus and bone marrow), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and plasma of rats, were determined to better understand mammalian antioxidant–oxidant and inflammatory system responses. For this purpose, rats were treated orally with different doses of thiacloprid (single acute dose of 112.5mg/kg); subacute dose of 22.5mg/kg/day for 30days; deltamethrin (single acute dose of 15mg/kg); subacute dose (3mg/kg/day for 30days), or a combination of these pesticides. Results were compared with those from a comparable dosing regimen with the known immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide. Pesticide treatments caused significant changes in the levels of liver and kidney injury markers. Antioxidant enzyme (catalase and glutathione peroxidase), glutathione and plasma antioxidant levels decreased but lipid peroxidation increased in all lymphoid organs and the plasma. Glutathione-S-transferase and especially DT-diaphorase activity, decreased after thiacloprid treatment. Myeloperoxidase activity, carbonyl content, lipid peroxidation and total nitrite levels increased in PMNs and plasma. When evaluated as a whole, the oxidative and inflammatory stresses seen in the pesticide combination groups were not much more pronounced than in the groups treated with a single pesticide. In terms of the evaluated biochemical parameters, the pesticides showed similar effects to cyclophosphamide.},

Various methods of chemical prevention of commercial winter and spring oilseed rape crops in field-realistic conditions were taken into account in the assessment. Pesticides were applied in accordance with the actual agricultural practice. Commercial crop protection products with thiamethoxam, clothianidin or imidacloprid were used as seed treatment. Formulations containing acetamiprid or thiacloprid were used for spraying. Fifteen healthy bee colonies were placed in close proximity to each of the oilseed rape fields throughout the blooming period. During florescence, the samples of nectar (directly from flowers and nectar flow from combs) and pollen loads were collected repeatedly. Samples of honey, bee bread and adult bees were taken one week after the end of plants flowering. To ensure high specificity and sensitivity of analysed pestcicides modified QuEChERS extraction method and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used. The five of neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiametoxam, acetamiprid and thiacloprid) were analyzed in multi-residue method with 0.1 - 10 ng/g limits of detection. Palynological analysis was done to determine the botanical origin of the nectar, honey and pollen. Development of bee colonies (brood area, worker biomass, colony health) was assessed every 3 weeks until the end of the beekeeping season. The amount of pollen collected by bees per hive, bee bread area and rape honey yield was also measured. The long-term effects of insecticides on bees were estimated using the same methods in April of the following year. {$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}All the neonicotinoid insecticides applied to control oilseed rape pests were present in the samples of nectar and pollen. Their residue levels were lower than the acute oral and contact LD50 values. Among five examined neonicotinoids, the most frequently detected were: thiamethoxam, thiacloprid and acetamiprid. These substances were present in 65, 64, and 51\% of the nectar samples and in 37, 62, and 45\% of the pollen samples, respectively. The highest level of residues were noted after the thiamethoxam seed treatment; on average, 4.2 and 3.8 ng/g in the nectar and pollen samples. In the nectar and pollen samples from winter rape fields, lower levels of neonicotinoid residues were found in comparison to spring rape samples. The contaminations of neonicotinoids applied as seed dressing in nectar samples were significantly higher in comparison to the pollen samples. No negative effects of neonicotinoids on the bee mortality, brood development, strength, and honey yield of healthy bee colonies were found throughout the study period. However, the risk exposure of bee colonies on adverse impact of pesticide residues is high in areas of intensively cultivated oilseed rape.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Neonicotinoids are now the most widely used insecticides in the world. They act systemically, travelling through plant tissues and protecting all parts of the crop, and are widely applied as seed dressings. As neurotoxins with high toxicity to most arthropods, they provide effective pest control and have numerous uses in arable farming and horticulture. However, the prophylactic use of broad-spectrum pesticides goes against the long-established principles of integrated pest management (IPM), leading to environmental concerns. It has recently emerged that neonicotinoids can persist and accumulate in soils. They are water soluble and prone to leaching into waterways. Being systemic, they are found in nectar and pollen of treated crops. Reported levels in soils, waterways, field margin plants and floral resources overlap substantially with concentrations that are sufficient to control pests in crops, and commonly exceed the LC50 (the concentration which kills 50\% of individuals) for beneficial organisms. Concentrations in nectar and pollen in crops are sufficient to impact substantially on colony reproduction in bumblebees. Although vertebrates are less susceptible than arthropods, consumption of small numbers of dressed seeds offers a route to direct mortality in birds and mammals. Synthesis and applications. Major knowledge gaps remain, but current use of neonicotinoids is likely to be impacting on a broad range of non-target taxa including pollinators and soil and aquatic invertebrates and hence threatens a range of ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The neonicotinoids imidacloprid, imidaclothiz, acetamiprid and thiacloprid consist of similar structural substituents but differ considerably with respect to soil use. Therefore, the effects of soil microbial activity on the degradation and bioefficacy persistence of the four neonicotinoids were evaluated. RESULTS: In unsterilised soils, 94.0\% of acetamiprid and 98.8\% of thiacloprid were degraded within 15 days, while only 22.5\% of imidacloprid and 25.1\% of imidaclothiz were degraded over a longer period of 25 days. In contrast, in sterilised soils, the degradation rates of acetamiprid and thiacloprid were respectively only 21.4\% and 27.6\%, whereas the degradation rates of imidaclothiz and imidacloprid were respectively 9.0\% and almost 0\% within 25 days. The degradation products of imidacloprid and imidaclothiz were identified as olefin, nitroso or guanidine metabolites, the degradation product of thiacloprid was identified as an amide metabolite and no degradation product of acetamiprid was detected. A bioefficacy assay revealed that the bioefficacy and persistence of imidacloprid, imidaclothiz, acetamiprid and thiacloprid against horsebean aphid A. craccivora were related to their degradation rate and the bioefficacy of their degradation products in soil. CONCLUSION: Soil microbial activity played a key role in the bioefficacy persistence of neonicotinoid insecticides and therefore significantly affected their technical profile after soil application.},

  abstract = {Synthetic pesticides such as neonicotinoids are commonly used to treat crops in tropical regions, where data on environmental and human contamination are patchy and make it difficult to assess to what extent pesticides may harm human health, especially in less developed countries. To assess the degree of environmental and human contamination with neonicotinoids we collected soil, water and people's hair in three agricultural regions of the Philippines and analysed them by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS-MS). Five neonicotinoids, namely acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam were targeted. Residues of neonicotinoids were found in 78\% of 67 soil samples from the three provinces. Total neonicotinoid loads ranged on average between 0.017 and 0.89~μg/kg in soils of rice, banana and vegetable crops, and were 130 times higher (113.5~μg/kg) in soils of a citrus grove. Imidacloprid was the most prevalent compound at an average of 0.56~μg/kg in soil while thiacloprid was below the limit of detection. Half of the eight water samples from a rice field and nearby creek contained residues of imidacloprid (mean 1.29~ng/L) and one contained thiamethoxam (0.15~ng/L). Residues of neonicotinoids were found in 81\% of 99 samples of people's hair from the surveyed regions (average total concentrations 0.14 to 1.18~ng/g, maximum 350~ng/g). Hair residue levels correlated well with the concentrations of thiamethoxam and total residues in soils from the same locality (r~=~0.98). The presence of thiacloprid in 15\% of the hair samples but not in soil samples suggests an additional route of exposure among people, which is most likely to be through ingestion of agricultural food and drinks available in the market.},

  abstract = {Between August 1989 and July 1990, California conducted a Mediterranean fruit fly eradication project in southern California which included repeated aerial applications of malathion bait to urban areas where approximately 1.6 million people resided. Concern about the safety of these applications prompted the California Department of Health Services to prepare a risk assessment. The current work presents the estimates of environmental levels of malathion and malaoxon, derived from mass deposition rates during application and monitoring of air. We estimated short and long-term malathion and malaoxon levels on outdoor surfaces, plants, and soils (0.1 and 1.0 cm mixing depth), using a simple first-order exponential decay model and literature half-life values ranging from three to nine days. Direct monitoring data were used to characterize short-term air levels. Average and upper-bound malathion levels immediately following an application were 0.091 microgram/m3 and 0.207 microgram/m3 in air; 22 and 52 mg/m2 on outdoor surfaces; 3.8 and 9.6 micrograms/g in plants; and 1.5 and 3.5 micrograms/g in soil (1 cm mixing depth). Malaoxon levels were 0.039 microgram/m3 and 0.110 microgram/m3 in air; 0.15 and 0.46 mg/m2, 0.03 and 0.09 microgram/g, and 0.01 and 0.03 microgram/g, respectively. Estimates of average and upper-bound levels over the duration of the eradication program were roughly one-third the immediate levels in all media. No field measurements were available for co-products other than malaoxon, for environmental persistence, or for concentrations on surfaces, soil, or plants after repeated applications. Because of limited monitoring data, and the likelihood that similar pest-eradication programs will be conducted, additional studies are warranted to more accurately characterize the environmental fate of malathion and human exposures after aerial application to residential communities.},

  abstract = {The cell wall of a yeast cell forms a barrier for various proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous molecules. Nisin, a small polypeptide and a well-known preservative active against gram-positive bacteria, was tested with wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This peptide had no effect on intact cells. However, removal of the cell wall facilitated access of nisin to the membrane and led to cell rupture. The roles of individual components of the cell wall in protection against nisin were studied by using synchronized cultures. Variation in nisin sensitivity was observed during the cell cycle. In the S phase, which is the phase in the cell cycle in which the permeability of the yeast wall to fluorescein isothiocyanate dextrans is highest, the cells were most sensitive to nisin. In contrast, the cells were most resistant to nisin after a peak in expression of the mRNA of cell wall protein 2 (Cwp2p), which coincided with the G2 phase of the cell cycle. A mutant lacking Cwp2p has been shown to be more sensitive to cell wall-interfering compounds and Zymolyase (J. M. Van der Vaart, L. H. Caro, J. W. Chapman, F. M. Klis, and C. T. Verrips, J. Bacteriol. 177:3104–3110, 1995). Here we show that of the single cell wall protein knockouts, a Cwp2p-deficient mutant is most sensitive to nisin. A mutant with a double knockout of Cwp1p and Cwp2p is hypersensitive to the peptide. Finally, in yeast mutants with impaired cell wall structure, expression of both CWP1 and CWP2 was modified. We concluded that Cwp2p plays a prominent role in protection of cells against antimicrobial peptides, such as nisin, and that Cwp1p and Cwp2p play a key role in the formation of a normal cell wall.},

Although neonicotinoid systemic insecticides used for seed coating of agricultural crops were suspected as possible reason, studies so far have not shown the existence of unquestionable sources capable of delivering directly intoxicating doses in the fields. Guttation is a natural plant phenomenon causing the excretion of xylem fluid at leaf margins. Here, we show that leaf guttation drops of all the corn plants germinated from neonicotinoid-coated seeds contained amounts of insecticide constantly higher than 10 mg/l, with maxima up to 100 mg/l for thiamethoxam and clothianidin, and up to 200 mg/l for imidacloprid. The concentration of neonicotinoids in guttation drops can be near those of active ingredients commonly applied in field sprays for pest control, or even higher. When bees consume guttation drops, collected from plants grown from neonicotinoid-coated seeds, they encounter death within few minutes.},

  abstract = {Regarding the hypothesis that neonicotinoid insecticides used for seed coating of agricultural crops – mainly corn, sunflower and seed rape – are related to the extensive death of honey bees, the phenomenon of corn seedling guttation has been recently considered as a possible route of exposure of bees to these systemic insecticides. In the present study, guttation drops of corn plants obtained from commercial seeds coated with thiamethoxam, clothianidin, imidacloprid and fipronil have been analyzed by an optimized fast UHPLC-DAD procedure showing excellent detection limits and accuracy, both adequate for the purpose. The young plants grown both in pots – in greenhouse – and in open field from coated seeds, produced guttation solutions containing high levels of the neonicotinoid insecticides (up to 346 mg L−1 for imidacloprid, 102 mg L−1 for clothianidin and 146 mg L−1 for thiamethoxam). These concentration levels may represent lethal doses for bees that use guttation drops as a source of water. The neonicotinoid concentrations in guttation drops progressively decrease during the first 10–15 days after the emergence of the plant from the soil. Otherwise fipronil, which is a non-systemic phenylpyrazole insecticide, was never detected into guttation drops. Current results confirm that the physiological fluids of the corn plant can effectively transfer neonicotinoid insecticides from the seed onto the surface of the leaves, where guttation drops may expose bees and other insects to elevated doses of neurotoxic insecticides.},

  abstract = {Little is known about the likelihood of occurrence of guttation fluids in sugar beet, and the extent to which its occurrence is related to weather conditions. There is also uncertainty regarding the extent to which the concentration of neonicotinoid residues in guttation fluid of seed treated sugar beet represents an environmentally relevant route of exposure for honey bees. In our study in 2009 and 2010, guttation monitoring, sampling and analysis of neonicotinoid residues in guttation fluids were conducted on 31 field sites consisting of differing landscapes with frequent cultivation of sugar beet. High concentrations of neonicotinoids in the guttation fluid up to 9~mg clothianidin L−1 were recorded, levels that would result in lethal effects to honey bees consuming such droplets. However, we demonstrated that the occurrence of guttation in sugar beet was very rare especially compared to the occurrence of guttation in the vegetation adjacent to sugar beet fields or the occurrence of dew. Therefore, we concluded that guttation fluids from seed treated sugar beet might not be a preferred water source for water foraging bees. Thus, an exposure of honey bee colonies to neonicotinoids dissolved in guttation fluids of seed treated sugar beet is very unlikely.},

  abstract = {Background: Depending on the location, various water sources may be available for bee colonies. These sources can be permanent, such as ponds, or incidental like dew or guttation droplets. The aim of the experiment was to investigate whether bees prefer guttation drops as a water source compared to dew or rain drops. Furthermore it was analysed if bees use these water sources up to a distance of 50m from their hives. Results: During the experiment 147 bees were observed scanning the surface of the plants without landing, 13 bees took up guttation fluid and 36 bees collected dew or rain drops. Few bees were observed collecting guttation fluid at 50m from their hives but most in close proximity of the hives. Furthermore, in some dead bees residues of the seed treatment were detected (imazalil: 0.0011 μg/bee – 0.329 μg/bee; LD50= 35.1 μg/bee). Conclusion: In the majority of observations, bees were spotted scanning the leaf area of the plants. Only single bees were observed that actually took up water from plant leaves. It seems these bees did not distinguish between dew, rain or guttation droplets. The majority of water collecting or bees resting on plants were observed in the close proximity of their hives.},

  abstract = {Background: Besides their nectar and pollen collecting activities, honey bees also forage water. Guttation droplets may be used as a water source. Measurements of high residue levels of some intrinsically highly toxic, systemic insecticides in guttation droplets triggered research activities on the potential risk for honey bees. Since 2009, a large number of studies have been conducted on the environmental conditions and factors favoring guttation, foraging of guttation, the occurrence of guttation in different crops, the frequency of guttation events and residue measurements in guttation droplets in different crops, at different growth stages and with different active ingredients. Different approaches of laboratory, semi-field and field studies were set up to address the potential risk of guttation to bees and to gain clarification whether and how this concern would need to be specifically addressed in the risk assessment for bees. Results: Occasionally increased mortalities of worker bees were reported from single events in some trials, when colonies were placed directly next to the sown maize crop treated with a systemic insecticide. However, there were no long-term colony effects (e.g. on colony strength and brood development) reported from any of the realistic worst case exposure trials conducted by either public research institutes or industry. Conclusion: The potential risk for bees is in the first instance dependent on the distance of the colonies to treated crops. Maize is considered as the worst case crop in terms of frequency, duration and intensity of guttation and of residue level of compounds found in guttation liquid. Though increased worker bee mortality on individual days was seen in some of the field studies where hives were placed directly at guttating maize fields, adverse effects to colony vitality, colony and brood development were never observed.},

This process is less understood than pesticide extraction with organic solvents. To elucidate the dissipation behavior of water-extractable pesticides in soils, we conducted an incubation study using 27 pesticides and five Japanese soils. The rate of decrease of the level of pesticides in water extracts was faster in soils than that of total extracts (water extracts and acetone extracts). This suggests that time-dependent sorption contributed to the difference in the dissipation between the pesticides in water and total extracts from soils. Increased apparent sorption coefficients (Kd,app) with time were positively and significantly correlated with Kd,app values of a 0 day incubation [Kd,app(t0)]. This empirical relationship suggests that Kd,app(t0) values can predict the time-dependent increase in Kd,app and the dissipation of water-extractable pesticides in soils.},

The concentration of 32 organophosphorus pesticides and 5 carbamates was determined through liquid–liquid extraction followed by gas chromatography with a nitrogen–phosphorus detector and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in positive and negative ion modes. The most contaminated samples were from Granarolo Emilia where cereals (wheat, sorghum, and corn), sugar beets, and potatoes are the main agriculture products. Thirty-five pesticides were detected, with organophosphorus being the most abundant ones. Malathion was detected in 58\% of the samples (mean level 0.360 mg/kg) followed by fenithrothion in 53\% of the samples (mean level 0.544 mg/kg) and pirimiphos methyl in 48\% of the samples (mean level 0.006 mg/kg). Temporal trends showed that the maximum detection frequency occurred in late spring and was associated with the use of treatment products and less rainfall. The obtained results demonstrated the feasibility of using honeybees for assessing pesticide exposure in agriculture settings.},
