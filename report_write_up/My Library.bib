  abstract = {The Guidance Document is intended to provide guidance for notifiers and authorities in the context of the review of plant protection products (PPPs) and their active substances under Regulation (EC) 1107/2009. The scientific opinion on the science behind the development of a risk assessment of plant protection products on bees (Apis mellifera, Bombus spp. and solitary bees) (EFSA Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR), 2012a) provided the scientific basis for the development of the Guidance Document. Specific Protection Goals were agreed in consultation with the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. The Guidance Document suggests a tiered risk assessment scheme with a simple and cost-effective first tier to more complex higher tier studies under field conditions. Each of the tiers will have to ensure that the appropriate level of protection is achieved.},

The context of the peer review was that required by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1141/2010 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 380/2013. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of glyphosate as a herbicide on emerged annual, perennial and biennial weeds in all crops [crops including but not restricted to root and tuber vegetables, bulb vegetables, stem vegetables, field vegetables (fruiting vegetables, brassica vegetables, leaf vegetables and fresh herbs, legume vegetables), pulses, oil seeds, potatoes, cereals, and sugar- and fodder beet; orchard crops and vine, before planting fruit crops, ornamentals, trees, nursery plants etc.] and foliar spraying for desiccation in cereals and oilseeds (pre-harvest). The reliable endpoints, concluded as being appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment and derived from the available studies and literature in the dossier peer reviewed, are presented. Missing information identified as being required by the regulatory framework is listed. Concerns are identified. Following a second mandate from the European Commission to consider the findings from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) regarding the potential carcinogenicity of glyphosate or glyphosate-containing plant protection products in the on-going peer review of the active substance, EFSA concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans and the evidence does not support classification with regard to its carcinogenic potential according to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008.},

  abstract = {Insecticide imidacloprid and herbicide glyphosate have a broad spectrum of applicable use in the agricultural sector of Egypt. Their ability to induce in vitro cytotoxic and oxidative stress on normal human cells (prostate epithelial WPM-Y.1 cell line) was evaluated with the methyl tetrazolium test (MTT) and histopathological investigation. Cell viability was evaluated with an MTT test for 24\,h. The median inhibition concentration (IC50) values were 0.023 and 0.025\,mM for imidacloprid and glyphosate, respectively. Sublethal concentrations: 1/10 and 1/50 of IC50 and IC50 levels significantly induced an increase in the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) level compared with the untreated cells. Rapid decrease in the glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity was induced. Significant increases were recorded in activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR), respectively, compared with the control group. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) investigation showed significant defects in the cells following pesticide treatments for 24\,h. Therefore, it is concluded that imidacloprid and glyphosate are very toxic in vitro assays and able to induce apoptotic effects as well as oxidative stress. So, these findings provide a scenario of multibiomarkers to achieve the imposed risks of pesticides at low doses.},

In honey bees (Apis mellifera), pollen, which is the main dietary source of proteins, amino acids and lipids, is essential to adult bee physiological development while reducing their susceptibility to parasites and pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying pollen's nutritive impact on honey bee health remained to be determined. For that purpose, we investigated the influence of pollen nutrients on the transcriptome of worker bees parasitized by the mite Varroa destructor, known for suppressing immunity and decreasing lifespan. The 4 experimental groups (control bees without a pollen diet, control bees fed with pollen, varroa-parasitized bees without a pollen diet and varroa-parasitized bees fed with pollen) were analyzed by performing a digital gene expression (DGE) analysis on bee abdomens.},

  abstract = {The classical studies of nicotine by Langley at the turn of the 20th century introduced the concept of a “receptive substance,” from which the idea of a “receptor” came to light. Subsequent studies aided by the Torpedo electric organ, a rich source of muscle-type nicotinic receptors (nAChRs), and the discovery of α-bungarotoxin, a snake toxin that binds pseudo-irreversibly to the muscle nAChR, resulted in the muscle nAChR being the best characterized ligand-gated ion channel hitherto. With the advancement of functional and genetic studies in the late 1980s, the existence of nAChRs in the mammalian brain was confirmed and the realization that the numerous nAChR subtypes contribute to the psychoactive properties of nicotine and other drugs of abuse and to the neuropathology of various diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and schizophrenia, has since emerged. This review provides a comprehensive overview of these findings and the more recent revelations of the impact that the rich diversity in function and expression of this receptor family has on neuronal and nonneuronal cells throughout the body. Despite these numerous developments, our understanding of the contributions of specific neuronal nAChR subtypes to the many facets of physiology throughout the body remains in its infancy.},

There is now information on the enzyme structure at all levels from primary (amino acid sequence) to quaternary (dimerization, association with other proteins) structure. The crystal structures of the oxygenase domains of inducible NOS (iNOS) and vascular endothelial NOS (eNOS) allow us to interpret other information in the context of this important part of the enzyme, with its binding sites for iron protoporphyrin IX (haem), biopterin, L-arginine, and the many inhibitors which interact with them. The exact nature of the NOS reaction, its mechanism and its products continue to be sources of controversy. The role of the biopterin cofactor is now becoming clearer, with emerging data implicating one-electron redox cycling as well as the multiple allosteric effects on enzyme activity. Regulation of the NOSs has been described at all levels from gene transcription to covalent modification and allosteric regulation of the enzyme itself. A wide range of NOS inhibitors have been discussed, interacting with the enzyme in diverse ways in terms of site and mechanism of inhibition, time-dependence and selectivity for individual isoforms, although there are many pitfalls and misunderstandings of these aspects. Highly selective inhibitors of iNOS versus eNOS and neuronal NOS have been identified and some of these have potential in the treatment of a range of inflammatory and other conditions in which iNOS has been implicated.},

Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate how an organophosphate insecticide, phosalone, affects lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the antioxidant defence system in vitro. For this purpose, the effects of various doses of phosalone on LPO and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) in erythrocytes were studied. Each phosalone dose was incubated with a previously prepared erythrocyte sample at +4~°C for 0, 60 and 180 min. After incubation, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activities of SOD, GSH-Px and CAT were determined. Phosalone caused an increase in MDA formation and a decrease in the activities of SOD, GSH-Px and CAT. However, these effects were seen only at extremely high concentrations of phosalone and these concentrations were in the lethal range. Therefore, we suggest that ROS may not involve in the toxic effects of the pesticidal use of phosalone in low concentrations.},

  abstract = {Reproductive competition in social insects is generally mediated through specific fertility pheromones. By analysing Dufour's gland secretion in queens and workers of Bombus terrestris under varying social conditions, we demonstrate here that the volatile constituents of the secretion exhibit a context-dependent composition. The secretion of egg-laying queens is composed of a series of aliphatic hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes), while that of sterile workers contains in addition octyl esters, dominated by octyl hexadecanoate and octyl oleate. These esters disappear in workers with developed ovaries, whether queenright (QR) or queenless (QL), rendering their secretion queen-like. This constitutes an unusual case in which the sterile caste, rather than the fertile one, possesses extra components. Individually isolated (socially deprived) workers developed ovaries successfully, but failed to oviposit, and still possessed the octyl esters. Thus, whereas social interactions are not needed in order to develop ovaries, they appear essential for oviposition and compositional changes in Dufour's gland secretion (ester disappearance). The apparent link between high ester levels and an inability to lay eggs lends credence to the hypothesis that these esters signal functional sterility. We hypothesize that by producing a sterility-specific secretion, workers signal that ‘I am out of the competition’, and therefore are not attacked, either by the queen or by the reproductive workers. This enables proper colony function and brood care, in particular sexual brood, even under the chaotic conditions of the competition phase.},

The context of the peer review was that requested by the European Commission following the submission and evaluation of confirmatory ecotoxicology data. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of sulfoxaflor as an insecticide on fruiting vegetables (field and greenhouse application), cucurbits (field and greenhouse application), spring and winter cereals (field application) and cotton (field application). The reliable endpoints concluded as being appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment, derived from the available studies and literature in the dossier peer reviewed, are presented. For the field and non-permanent structure greenhouses, a high risk to honeybees and bumble bees was identified related to some pertinent scenarios (treated crop scenario except after flowering period, weed scenario, field margin scenario). A low risk was concluded for honeybees, bumble bees and solitary bees in case of permanent structure greenhouse provided the low exposure in such scenarios. The European Commission mandated EFSA to complete the assessment of the spray drift reducing measures necessary to protect bumblebees and solitary bees in field margins from exposure to sulfoxaflor and to complete the assessment of the risk to bees from puddle water.},

  abstract = {Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) terminates neurotransmission at cholinergic synapses by hydrolysing acetylcholine, but also has non-enzymatic morphoregulatory effects on neurons such as stimulation of neurite outgrowth. It is widely expressed outside the nervous system, but its function in non-neuronal cells is unclear. Here we have investigated the distribution and function of AChE in fibroblasts and astrocytes. We show that these cells express high levels of AChE protein that co-migrates with recombinant AChE but contains little catalytic activity. Fibroblasts express transcripts encoding the synaptic AChE-T isoform and its membrane anchoring peptide PRiMA-I. AChE is strikingly distributed in arcs, rings and patches at the leading edge of spreading and migrating fibroblasts and astrocytes, close to the cell–substratum interface, and in neuronal growth cones. During in vivo healing of mouse skin, AChE becomes highly expressed in re-epithelialising epidermal keratinocytes 1 day after wounding. AChE appears to be functionally important for polarised cell migration, since an AChE antibody reduces substratum adhesion of fibroblasts, and slows wound healing in vitro as effectively as a β1-integrin antibody. Moreover, elevation of AChE expression increases fibroblast wound healing independently of catalytic activity. Interestingly, AChE surface patches precisely co-localise with amyloid precursor protein and the extracellular matrix protein perlecan, but not focal adhesions or α-dystroglycan, and contain a high concentration of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in spreading cells. These findings suggest that cell surface AChE, possibly in a novel signalling complex containing APP and perlecan, contributes to a generalised mechanism for polarised membrane protrusion and migration in all adherent cells.

In the current study, we evaluate the effects of chronic oral exposure to spinosad during the larval phase on survival, developmental time, body mass, midgut epithelial remodeling, and the peritrophic matrix (PM) of Partamona helleri stingless bee workers. Worker larvae that were raised in the laboratory were orally exposed to different concentrations (0, 6.53, 13.06, 32.64, and 3,264 ng. a.i. bee−1) of spinosad (formulation), and the resulting survival, developmental time, and body mass were studied. The concentration of spinosad recommended for use in the field (3,264 ng. a.i. bee−1) reduced the survival of workers during development. Also, sublethal concentrations of spinosad delayed the development and caused morphological changes in the midgut epithelium. Finally, the chronic exposure of larvae to 32.64 ng. a.i. bee−1 spinosad also altered the remodeling of the midgut during metamorphosis and affected the organization of the PM of larvae, pupae, and adults. Our data suggest possible environmental risks for using spinosad in cultures that are naturally pollinated by stingless bees.},

  abstract = {Pesticide exposure has been implicated as a contributor to insect pollinator declines. In social bees, which are crucial pollination service providers, the effect of low-level chronic exposure is typically non-lethal leading researchers to consider whether exposure induces sublethal effects on behaviour and whether such impairment can affect colony development. Studies under laboratory conditions can control levels of pesticide exposure and elucidate causative effects, but are often criticized for being unrealistic. In contrast, field studies can monitor bee responses under a more realistic pesticide exposure landscape; yet typically such findings are limited to correlative results and can lack true controls or sufficient replication. We attempt to bridge this gap by exposing bumblebees to known amounts of pesticides when colonies are placed in the field. Using 20 bumblebee colonies, we assess the consequences of exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin, provided in sucrose at a concentration of five parts per billion, over 5 weeks. We monitored foraging patterns and pollen collecting performance from 3282 bouts using either a non-invasive photographic assessment, or by extracting the pollen from returning foragers. We also conducted a full colony census at the beginning and end of the experiment. In contrast to studies on other neonicotinoids, showing clear impairment to foraging behaviours, we detected only subtle changes to patterns of foraging activity and pollen foraging during the course of the experiment. However, our colony census measures showed a more pronounced effect of exposure, with fewer adult workers and sexuals in treated colonies after 5 weeks. Synthesis and applications. Pesticide-induced impairments on colony development and foraging could impact on the pollination service that bees provide. Therefore, our findings, that bees show subtle changes in foraging behaviour and reductions in colony size after exposure to a common pesticide, have important implications and help to inform the debate over whether the benefits of systemic pesticide application to flowering crops outweigh the costs. We propose that our methodology is an important advance to previous semi-field methods and should be considered when considering improvements to current ecotoxicological guidelines for pesticide risk assessment.},

  abstract = {One of the devastating effects of acute exposure to organophosphates, like nerve agents, is the induction of severe and prolonged status epilepticus (SE), which can cause death, or brain damage if death is prevented. Seizures after exposure are initiated by muscarinic receptor hyperstimulation—after inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by the organophosphorus agent and subsequent elevation of acetylcholine—but they are reinforced and sustained by glutamatergic hyperexcitation, which is the primary cause of brain damage. Diazepam is the FDA-approved anticonvulsant for the treatment of nerve agent-induced SE, and its replacement by midazolam is currently under consideration. However, clinical data derived from the treatment of SE of any etiology, as well as studies on the control of nerve agent-induced SE in animal models, have indicated that diazepam and midazolam control seizures only temporarily, their antiseizure efficacy is reduced as the latency of treatment from the onset of SE increases, and their neuroprotective efficacy is limited or absent. Here, we review data on the discovery of a novel anticonvulsant and neuroprotectant, LY293558, an AMPA/GluK1 receptor antagonist. Treatment of soman-exposed immature, young-adult, and aged rats with LY293558, terminates SE with limited recurrence of seizures, significantly protects from brain damage, and prevents long-term behavioral deficits, even when LY293558 is administered 1 h post-exposure. More beneficial effects and complete neuroprotection is obtained when LY293558 administration is combined with caramiphen, which antagonizes NMDA receptors. Further efficacy studies may bring the LY293558 + caramiphen combination therapy on the pathway to approval for human use.},

  abstract = {The honeybee, Apis mellifera is economically important for its products (honey, wax, and propolis) and for its role in pollination. This insect is threated due to high population losses in both agriculture and beekeeping. Within causes involved in the loss of honeybees is the increased pesticide use on agriculture. Although current testing for the regularization of insecticide use considers its acute toxic effects on pollinators, little is known about the effects of chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations that may persist in the environment. This study investigated the effect of chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of lambda-cyhalothrin on the midgut, hypopharyngeal glands, and brain of A.~mellifera. Honey bees were fed for eight days with LC50/100 insecticide. Subsequently, the midgut, hypopharyngeal glands, and brain were analyzed in light and transmission electron microscopies. The midgut was not affected after exposure, except in the posterior region with cell fragments in the lumen and changes in the mitochondria. The hypopharyngeal glands were severely affected by the insecticide with changes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and cell death. The brain has extensive gaps in the neuropil as well as in the cellular bodies, especially in the corpora pedunculata. These resembled cellular alterations similar to those seen in death processes. The results of this study indicate that lambda-cyhalothrin is toxic to bees at sublethal concentrations and ingested chronically, causing damage to the midgut, hypopharyngeal glands, and brain, and may affect physiological and behavioral aspects of these insects.},

  abstract = {There is a growing body of empirical evidence showing that wild and managed bees are negatively impacted by various pesticides that are applied in agroecosystems around the world. The lethal and sublethal effects of two widely used fungicides and one adjuvant were assessed in cage studies in California on blue orchard bees, Osmia lignaria, and in cage studies in Utah on alfalfa leafcutting bees, Megachile rotundata. The fungicides tested were Rovral 4F (iprodione) and Pristine (mixture of pyraclostrobin + boscalid), and the adjuvant tested was N-90, a non-ionic wetting agent (90\% polyethoxylated nonylphenol) added to certain tank mixtures of fungicides to improve the distribution and contact of sprays to plants. In separate trials, we erected screened cages and released 20 paint-marked females plus 30–50 males per cage to document the behavior of nesting bees under treated and control conditions. For all females in each cage, we recorded pollen-collecting trip times, nest substrate-collecting trip times (i.e., mud for O. lignaria and cut leaf pieces for M. rotundata), cell production rate, and the number of attempts each female made to enter her own or to enter other nest entrances upon returning from a foraging trip. No lethal effects of treatments were observed on adults, nor were there effects on time spent foraging for pollen and nest substrates and on cell production rate. However, Rovral 4F, Pristine, and N-90 disrupted the nest recognition abilities of O. lignaria females. Pristine, N-90, and Pristine + N-90 disrupted nest recognition ability of M. rotundata females. Electroantennogram responses of antennae of O. lignaria females maintained in the laboratory did not differ significantly between the fungicide-exposed and control bees. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that two commonly used fungicides and a non-ionic adjuvant can disrupt nest recognition in two managed solitary bee species.},

From their introduction on the market, they have received significant attention from the scientific community, particularly regarding the assessment of lethal and sublethal effects on bees. The availability of scientific evidence alongside some concerns raised on the bee health led to the development of more articulate risk assessment methodologies for pesticides. To support the European Commission in its decision-making process, since 2012 EFSA has been requested to evaluate the risk to bees posed by the exposure to neonicotinoids. The outcome of the EFSA evaluations has been used by risk managers to revise the approval conditions of the substances clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam and to impose severe restrictions on their use. Meanwhile, a number of new studies have been carried out. EFSA is evaluating these data in order to further support the decision-making process with updated scientific assessments.},

  abstract = {Dye exclusion tests are used to determine the number of live and dead cells. These assays are based on the principle that intact plasma membranes in live cells exclude specific dyes, whereas dead cells do not. Although widely used, the trypan blue (TB) exclusion assay has limitations. The dye can be incorporated by live cells after a short exposure time, and personal reliability, related to the expertise of the analyst, can affect the results. We propose an alternative assay for evaluating cell viability that combines the TB exclusion test and the high sensitivity of the flow cytometry technique. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of TB to emit fluorescence when complexed with proteins. According to our results, TB/bovine serum albumin and TB/cytoplasmic protein complexes emit fluorescence at 660 nm, which is detectable by flow cytometry using a 650-nm low-pass band filter. TB at 0.002\% (w/v) was defined as the optimum concentration for distinguishing unstained living cells from fluorescent dead cells, and fluorescence emission was stable for 30 min after cell treatment. Although previous studies have shown that TB promotes green fluorescence quenching, TB at 0.002\% did not interfere with green fluorescence in human live T-cells stained with anti-CD3/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) monoclonal antibody. We observed a high correlation between the percentage of propidium iodide+CD3/FITC+ and TB+CD3/FITC+ cells, as well as similar double-stained cell profiles in flow cytometry dot-plot graphs. Taken together, the results indicate that a TB exclusion assay by flow cytometry can be employed as an alternative tool for quick and reliable cell viability analysis.},

Recently, a pesticide combining deltamethrin and thiacloprid has also been released. In the present study, the acute and subacute toxic effects of deltamethrin, thiachlopride, and a combination of these insecticides, on the lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus and bone marrow), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and plasma of rats, were determined to better understand mammalian antioxidant–oxidant and inflammatory system responses. For this purpose, rats were treated orally with different doses of thiacloprid (single acute dose of 112.5mg/kg); subacute dose of 22.5mg/kg/day for 30days; deltamethrin (single acute dose of 15mg/kg); subacute dose (3mg/kg/day for 30days), or a combination of these pesticides. Results were compared with those from a comparable dosing regimen with the known immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide. Pesticide treatments caused significant changes in the levels of liver and kidney injury markers. Antioxidant enzyme (catalase and glutathione peroxidase), glutathione and plasma antioxidant levels decreased but lipid peroxidation increased in all lymphoid organs and the plasma. Glutathione-S-transferase and especially DT-diaphorase activity, decreased after thiacloprid treatment. Myeloperoxidase activity, carbonyl content, lipid peroxidation and total nitrite levels increased in PMNs and plasma. When evaluated as a whole, the oxidative and inflammatory stresses seen in the pesticide combination groups were not much more pronounced than in the groups treated with a single pesticide. In terms of the evaluated biochemical parameters, the pesticides showed similar effects to cyclophosphamide.},

A RNA molecule of 3.5 kilobases was identified as the PDR1 transcript. The nucleotide sequence of the complementing DNA fragment contained a 3192-nucleotide open reading frame. Disruption of the pdr1 and PDR1 genes restored or increased drug sensitivity. Analysis of the PDR1 deduced amino acid sequence revealed several homologies to four different regulatory proteins involved in the control of gene expression, including a cysteine-rich motif suggested to be a metal-binding domain for DNA recognition. A model is proposed of a general transcriptional control by PDR1 of several target genes encoding proteins from plasma, mitochondria, and possibly other permeability barriers.},

Acetylcholine esterase (AChE), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and GSH level were also assayed in lymphocytes. The level of thiobarbituric acid reacting substances and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase and GGT were increased and GSH level was decreased in pesticide poisoning. Apparently lindane (at the concentration examined) was more potent than malathion and propoxur in producing alteration in lipid peroxidation, GSH related parameters and OFR scavenging enzymes. However, AChE activity and GSH level in lymphocytes of malathion poisoning cases were reduced and GGT activity was enhanced in comparison to control subjects. The present results suggest that OFR scavenging enzymes were induced while combating oxidative stress in a differential manner in organochlorine, organophosphate and carbamate poisoning. Increased lipid peroxidation, coupled with altered levels of GSH and OFR scavenging enzymes in the blood are discussed in the light of oxidative stress.},

Intriguingly, the long-lived mutants, ranging from yeast to mice, share some important phenotypic characteristics, including reduced insulin signaling, enhanced sensitivity to insulin, and reduced IGF-I plasma levels. Such genetic homologies and phenotypic similarities between insulin/IGF-I pathway mutants raise the possibility that the fundamental mechanism of aging may be evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. Very recent findings also provide novel and intriguing evidence for the involvement of insulin and IGF-I in the control of aging and longevity in humans. In this study, we focus on how the insulin/IGF-I pathway controls yeast, nematode, fruit fly, and rodent life spans and how it is related to the aging process in humans to outline the prospect of a unifying mechanism in the genetics of longevity.},

  abstract = {Azadirachtin is a biorational insecticide commonly reported as selective to a range of beneficial insects. Nonetheless, only few studies have been carried out with pollinators, usually emphasizing the honeybee Apis mellifera and neglecting other important pollinator species such as the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Here, lethal and sublethal effects of azadirachtin were studied on B. terrestris via oral exposure in the laboratory to bring out the potential risks of the compound to this important pollinator. The compound was tested at different concentrations above and below the maximum concentration that is used in the field (32~mg~L−1). As most important results, azadirachtin repelled bumblebee workers in a concentration-dependent manner. The median repellence concentration (RC50) was estimated as 504~mg~L−1. Microcolonies chronically exposed to azadirachtin via treated sugar water during 11~weeks in the laboratory exhibited a high mortality ranging from 32 to 100~\% with a range of concentrations between 3.2 and 320~mg~L−1. Moreover, no reproduction was scored when concentrations were higher than 3.2~mg L−1. At 3.2~mg L−1, azadirachtin significantly inhibited the egg-laying and, consequently, the production of drones during 6~weeks. Ovarian length decreased with the increase of the azadirachtin concentration. When azadirachtin was tested under an experimental setup in the laboratory where bumblebees need to forage for food, the sublethal effects were stronger as the numbers of drones were reduced already with a concentration of 0.64~mg~L−1. Besides, a negative correlation was found between the body mass of male offspring and azadirachtin concentration. In conclusion, our results as performed in the laboratory demonstrated that azadirachtin can affect B. terrestris with a range of sublethal effects. Taking into account that sublethal effects are as important as lethal effects for the development and survival of the colonies of B. terrestris, this study confirms the need to test compounds on their safety, especially when they have to perform complex tasks such as foraging. The latter agrees with the recent European Food Safety Authority guidelines to assess ‘potentially deleterious’ compounds for sublethal effects on behavior.},

  abstract = {Pollinators are in global decline and agricultural pesticides are a potential driver of this. Recent studies have suggested that pesticides may significantly impact bumblebee colonies—an important and declining group of pollinators. Here, we show that colony-founding queens, a critical yet vulnerable stage of the bumblebee lifecycle, are less likely to initiate a colony after exposure to thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid insecticide. Bombus terrestris queens were exposed to field-relevant levels of thiamethoxam and two natural stressors: the parasite Crithidia bombi and varying hibernation durations. Exposure to thiamethoxam caused a 26\% reduction in the proportion of queens that laid eggs, and advanced the timing of colony initiation, although we did not detect impacts of any experimental treatment on the ability of queens to produce adult offspring during the 14-week experimental period. As expected from previous studies, the hibernation duration also had an impact on egg laying, but there was no significant interaction with insecticide treatment. Modelling the impacts of a 26\% reduction in colony founding on population dynamics dramatically increased the likelihood of population extinction. This shows that neonicotinoids can affect this critical stage in the bumblebee lifecycle and may have significant impacts on population dynamics.},

Neonicotinoid pesticides have been implicated as a potential driver of these declines, but most of our evidence base comes from studies of a single species. There is an urgent need to understand whether such results can be generalized across a range of species. Here, we present results of a laboratory experiment testing the impacts of field-relevant doses (1.87–5.32 ppb) of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on spring-caught wild queens of four bumblebee species: Bombus terrestris, B. lucorum, B. pratorum and B. pascuorum. Two weeks of exposure to the higher concentration of thiamethoxam caused a reduction in feeding in two out of four species, suggesting species-specific anti-feedant, repellency or toxicity effects. The higher level of thiamethoxam exposure resulted in a reduction in the average length of terminal oocytes in queens of all four species. In addition to providing the first evidence for general effects of neonicotinoids on ovary development in multiple species of wild bumblebee queens, the discovery of species-specific effects on feeding has significant implications for current practices and policy for pesticide risk assessment and use.},

  abstract = {Hypothesis-based no-effect-concentration (NOEC) and regression-based x\% effect concentration (ECx) values are common statistical approaches used to summarize ecotoxicological effects. Controversy over the NOEC model has prompted a movement toward discontinuation of the NOEC in favor of ECx, but the best x\% effect surrogate for NOEC has not yet been determined. Historically, 10\% and 20\% effect concentrations (EC10 and EC20) have been treated as NOEC analogs. Given these measurements' importance to ecotoxicology, further understanding of the relationships between NOEC and EC10 or EC20 is crucial. In the present study, a metadataset of daphnid chronic toxicity tests was compiled to analyze the strength and significance of NOEC:EC10 and NOEC:EC20 relationships. The impact of endpoint (e.g., mortality, reproduction) and test condition parameters (e.g., pH, temperature) on NOEC:EC10 and NOEC:EC20 was evaluated. Mortality endpoints were most sensitive 51\% of the time, with growth and reproductive endpoints constituting the remainder, underscoring the value of using multiple endpoints to evaluate toxic effects rather than relying on reproduction as the a priori most sensitive endpoint. When test condition parameters were less restricted (e.g., pH, hardness), the NOEC:EC20 association was more robust, suggesting that variability introduced by test implementation increased variability in ECx calculation. The analysis revealed that, overall, EC10 was a more suitable analog than EC20 for NOEC. Recommendations include refinement and reporting of the test parameters pH and hardness to minimize variability in ECx calculation. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:2378–2384. © 2015 SETAC},

  abstract = {Neonicotinoids are effective insecticides used on many important arable and horticultural crops. They are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists which disrupt the function of insect neurons and cause paralysis and death. In addition to direct mortality, there are numerous sublethal effects of low doses of neonicotinoids on bees. We hypothesize that some of these large array of effects could be a consequence of epigenetic changes in bees induced by neonicotinoids. We compared whole methylome (BS-seq) and RNA-seq libraries of the brains of buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris workers exposed to field-realistic doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid to libraries from control workers. We found numerous genes which show differential expression between neonicotinoid-treated bees and control bees, but no differentially methylated cytosines in any context. We found CpG methylation to be focused mainly in exons and associated with highly expressed genes. We discuss the implications of our results for future legislation.},

In response to mounting evidence supporting the detrimental effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on pollinators, a novel ‘bee safe’ butenolide compound, flupyradifurone (FPF) has been registered for use in agricultural use. Although FPF is not a neonicotinoid, like neonicotinoids, it is an excitotoxic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. In addition, A. mellifera faces threats from pathogens, such as the microsporidian endoparasite, Nosema ceranae (Fries et al. 1996). We therefore sought 1) to increase our understanding of the potential effects of FPF on honey bees by focusing on a crucial behavior, the ability to learn and remember an odor associated with a food reward, and 2) to test for a potential synergistic effect on such learning by exposure to FPF and infection with N. ceranae. We found little evidence that FPF significantly alters learning and memory at short-term field-realistic doses. However, at high doses and at chronic, field-realistic exposure, FPF did reduce learning and memory in an olfactory conditioning task. Infection with N. ceranae also reduced learning, but there was no synergy (no significant interaction) between N. ceranae and exposure to FPF. These results suggest the importance of continued studies on the chronic effects of FPF.},

Indeed, a significant decrease of cell viability was observed for 50 and 100μM imidacloprid at 8 and 24h, with trypan blue exclusion test. Study of the AK activity revealed that 50 and 100μM imidacloprid induced an increase of AK activity, except for 50μM at 24h whereas at the same concentrations, clothianidin induced a transient effect at 5 and 8h. According to previous studies showing that imidacloprid was a partial agonist and clothianidin a full agonist of insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, we demonstrated that both imidacloprid and clothianidin were also able to induce distinct intracellular toxic effects.},

  abstract = {We examined the expression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the nervous system and epidermal body structures during embryonic and larval development of two grasshopper species: Locusta migratoria and Schistocerca americana. Histochemical labelling was blocked by the enzyme inhibitors eserine and BW284c51, but not by iso-OMPA, showing that the staining reflected true AChE activity. The majority of staining was localized on the cell surface but granular intracellular staining was also visible in many cell bodies. In both species, the cellular expression of AChE followed a similar but complex spatiotemporal staining pattern. Initially, mainly epidermal tissue structures were stained in the various body appendages (stages 25\%–30\%). Labelling subsequently appeared in outgrowing neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) and in the nerves innervating the limbs and dorsal body wall (stages 30\%–40\%). The latter staining originated in motoneurons of the ventral nerve cord. In a third phase (after 45\%), the somata of certain identified mechanosensory neurons started to express AChE activity, presumably reflecting cholinergic differentiation. Staining was also found in repo-positive glial cells of the CNS, longitudinal glia of connectives, glia of the stomatogastric nervous system and glial cells ensheathing peripheral nerves. Glial cells remained AChE-positive during larval to adult development, whereas motoneurons lost their AChE expression. The expression pattern in non-neuronal cells and glutamatergic motoneurons and the developmental appearance of AChE prior to synaptogenesis in the CNS suggest non-cholinergic functions of AChE during grasshopper embryogenesis.},

In order to elucidate the genotoxic potency of the main compounds present in commercial preparations of malathion, the DNA-damaging effect of this insecticide, its major metabolite malaoxon [S-(1,2-dicarboethoxyethyl)O,O-dimethyl phosphorothiolate] and its isomer isomalathion [S-(1,2-dicarboethoxyethyl)O,S-dimethyl phosphorodithioate], all at purity of at least 99.8\%, was investigated by use of the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Freshly isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes were incubated with 25, 75 and 200 μM of the chemicals for 1 h at 37°C. The concentrations used are comparable to those found in blood following various non-lethal human exposures to pesticides. Malathion did not cause any significant changes in the comet length of the lymphocytes, throughout the range of concentrations tested. Malaoxon and isomalathion introduced damage to DNA in a dose-dependent manner. The effect induced by malaoxon was more pronounced than that caused by isomalathion. Treated cells were able to recover within a 60-min incubation in insecticide-free medium at 37°C except the lymphocytes exposed to malaoxon at 200 μM, which did not show measurable DNA repair. The latter result suggests a considerable cytotoxic effect (cell death) of malaoxon at the highest concentration used. The reported genotoxicity of malathion might, therefore, be a consequence of its metabolic biotransformation to malaoxon or the presence of malaoxon and/or isomalathion as well as other unspecified impurities in commercial formulations of malathion. In this regard, the results of our study clearly indicate that malathion used as commercial product, i.e., containing malaoxon and isomalathion, can be considered as a genotoxic substance in vitro. This means that it may also produce DNA disturbances in vivo, such as DNA breakage at sites of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, thus playing a role in the induction of malignancies in individuals exposed to this agent. Therefore, malathion can be regarded as a potential mutagen/carcinogen and requires further investigation.},

  abstract = {Systemic insecticides are applied to plants using a wide variety of methods, ranging from foliar sprays to seed treatments and soil drenches. Neonicotinoids and fipronil are among the most widely used pesticides in the world. Their popularity is largely due to their high toxicity to invertebrates, the ease and flexibility with which they can be applied, their long persistence, and their systemic nature, which ensures that they spread to all parts of the target crop. However, these properties also increase the probability of environmental contamination and exposure of nontarget organisms. Environmental contamination occurs via a number of routes including dust generated during drilling of dressed seeds, contamination and accumulation in arable soils and soil water, runoff into waterways, and uptake of pesticides by nontarget plants via their roots or dust deposition on leaves. Persistence in soils, waterways, and nontarget plants is variable but can be prolonged; for example, the half-lives of neonicotinoids in soils can exceed 1,000~days, so they can accumulate when used repeatedly. Similarly, they can persist in woody plants for periods exceeding 1~year. Breakdown results in toxic metabolites, though concentrations of these in the environment are rarely measured. Overall, there is strong evidence that soils, waterways, and plants in agricultural environments and neighboring areas are contaminated with variable levels of neonicotinoids or fipronil mixtures and their metabolites (soil, parts per billion (ppb)-parts per million (ppm) range; water, parts per trillion (ppt)-ppb range; and plants, ppb-ppm range). This provides multiple routes for chronic (and acute in some cases) exposure of nontarget animals. For example, pollinators are exposed through direct contact with dust during drilling; consumption of pollen, nectar, or guttation drops from seed-treated crops, water, and consumption of contaminated pollen and nectar from wild flowers and trees growing near-treated crops. Studies of food stores in honeybee colonies from across the globe demonstrate that colonies are routinely and chronically exposed to neonicotinoids, fipronil, and their metabolites (generally in the 1–100~ppb range), mixed with other pesticides some of which are known to act synergistically with neonicotinoids. Other nontarget organisms, particularly those inhabiting soils, aquatic habitats, or herbivorous insects feeding on noncrop plants in farmland, will also inevitably receive exposure, although data are generally lacking for these groups. We summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the environmental fate of these compounds by outlining what is known about the chemical properties of these compounds, and placing these properties in the context of modern agricultural practices.},

To assess the degree of environmental and human contamination with neonicotinoids we collected soil, water and people's hair in three agricultural regions of the Philippines and analysed them by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS-MS). Five neonicotinoids, namely acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam were targeted. Residues of neonicotinoids were found in 78\% of 67 soil samples from the three provinces. Total neonicotinoid loads ranged on average between 0.017 and 0.89~μg/kg in soils of rice, banana and vegetable crops, and were 130 times higher (113.5~μg/kg) in soils of a citrus grove. Imidacloprid was the most prevalent compound at an average of 0.56~μg/kg in soil while thiacloprid was below the limit of detection. Half of the eight water samples from a rice field and nearby creek contained residues of imidacloprid (mean 1.29~ng/L) and one contained thiamethoxam (0.15~ng/L). Residues of neonicotinoids were found in 81\% of 99 samples of people's hair from the surveyed regions (average total concentrations 0.14 to 1.18~ng/g, maximum 350~ng/g). Hair residue levels correlated well with the concentrations of thiamethoxam and total residues in soils from the same locality (r~=~0.98). The presence of thiacloprid in 15\% of the hair samples but not in soil samples suggests an additional route of exposure among people, which is most likely to be through ingestion of agricultural food and drinks available in the market.},

  abstract = {Neonicotinoids have been the most commonly used insecticides since the early 1990s. Despite their efficacy in improving crop protection and management, these agrochemicals have gained recent attention for their negative impacts on non-target species such as honeybees and aquatic invertebrates. In recent years, neonicotinoids have been detected in rivers and streams across the world. Determining and predicting the exposure potential of neonicotinoids in surface water requires a thorough understanding of their fate and transport mechanisms. Therefore, our objective was to provide a comprehensive review of neonicotinoids with a focus on their fate and transport mechanisms to and within surface waters and their occurrence in waterways throughout the world. A better understanding of fate and transport mechanisms will enable researchers to accurately predict occurrence and persistence of insecticides entering surface waters and potential exposure to non-target organisms in agricultural intensive regions. This review has direct implications on how neonicotinoids are monitored and degraded in aquatic ecosystems. Further, an improved understanding of the fate and transport of neonicotinoids aide natural resource practitioners in the development and implementation of effective best management practices to reduce the potential impact and exposure of neonicotinoids in waterways and aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Between August 1989 and July 1990, California conducted a Mediterranean fruit fly eradication project in southern California which included repeated aerial applications of malathion bait to urban areas where approximately 1.6 million people resided. Concern about the safety of these applications prompted the California Department of Health Services to prepare a risk assessment. The current work presents the estimates of environmental levels of malathion and malaoxon, derived from mass deposition rates during application and monitoring of air. We estimated short and long-term malathion and malaoxon levels on outdoor surfaces, plants, and soils (0.1 and 1.0 cm mixing depth), using a simple first-order exponential decay model and literature half-life values ranging from three to nine days. Direct monitoring data were used to characterize short-term air levels. Average and upper-bound malathion levels immediately following an application were 0.091 microgram/m3 and 0.207 microgram/m3 in air; 22 and 52 mg/m2 on outdoor surfaces; 3.8 and 9.6 micrograms/g in plants; and 1.5 and 3.5 micrograms/g in soil (1 cm mixing depth). Malaoxon levels were 0.039 microgram/m3 and 0.110 microgram/m3 in air; 0.15 and 0.46 mg/m2, 0.03 and 0.09 microgram/g, and 0.01 and 0.03 microgram/g, respectively. Estimates of average and upper-bound levels over the duration of the eradication program were roughly one-third the immediate levels in all media. No field measurements were available for co-products other than malaoxon, for environmental persistence, or for concentrations on surfaces, soil, or plants after repeated applications. Because of limited monitoring data, and the likelihood that similar pest-eradication programs will be conducted, additional studies are warranted to more accurately characterize the environmental fate of malathion and human exposures after aerial application to residential communities.},

Thus, a more complex collection of secreted and membrane proteins had to be synthesized, modified, and folded. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) thereby became equipped with devoted enzymes and associated factors that both catalyze the production of secreted proteins and remove damaged proteins. A means to modify ER function to accommodate and destroy misfolded proteins also evolved. Not surprisingly, a growing number of human diseases are linked to various facets of ER function. Each of these topics will be discussed in this article, with an emphasis on recent reports in the literature that employed diverse models.},

  abstract = {The mitochondrion is at the core of cellular energy metabolism, being the site of most ATP generation. Calcium is a key regulator of mitochondrial function and acts at several levels within the organelle to stimulate ATP synthesis. However, the dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis is now recognized to play a key role in several pathologies. For example, mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ overload can lead to enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species, triggering of the permeability transition pore, and cytochrome c release, leading to apoptosis. Despite progress regarding the independent roles of both Ca2+ and mitochondrial dysfunction in disease, the molecular mechanisms by which Ca2+ can elicit mitochondrial dysfunction remain elusive. This review highlights the delicate balance between the positive and negative effects of Ca2+ and the signaling events that perturb this balance. Overall, a “two-hit” hypothesis is developed, in which Ca2+ plus another pathological stimulus can bring about mitochondrial dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Recent high annual losses of honey bee colonies are associated with many factors, including RNA virus infections. Honey bee antiviral responses include RNA interference and immune pathway activation, but their relative roles in antiviral defense are not well understood. To better characterize the mechanism(s) of honey bee antiviral defense, bees were infected with a model virus in the presence or absence of dsRNA, a virus associated molecular pattern. Regardless of sequence specificity, dsRNA reduced virus abundance. We utilized next generation sequencing to examine transcriptional responses triggered by virus and dsRNA at three time-points post-infection. Hundreds of genes exhibited differential expression in response to co-treatment of dsRNA and virus. Virus-infected bees had greater expression of genes involved in RNAi, Toll, Imd, and JAK-STAT pathways, but the majority of differentially expressed genes are not well characterized. To confirm the virus limiting role of two genes, including the well-characterized gene, dicer, and a probable uncharacterized cyclin dependent kinase in honey bees, we utilized RNAi to reduce their expression in vivo and determined that virus abundance increased, supporting their involvement in antiviral defense. Together, these results further our understanding of honey bee antiviral defense, particularly the role of a non-sequence specific dsRNA-mediated antiviral pathway.},

Analyses of large-scale datasets to investigate the real-world links between the use of neonicotinoids and pollinator mortality are lacking. Moreover, the impacts of neonicotinoid seed coatings in reducing subsequent applications of foliar insecticide sprays and increasing crop yield are not known, despite the supposed benefits of this practice driving widespread use. Here, we combine large-scale pesticide usage and yield observations from oilseed rape with those detailing honey bee colony losses over an 11 year period and reveal a correlation between honey bee colony losses and national-scale imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid) usage patterns across England and Wales. We also provide the first evidence that farmers who use neonicotinoid seed coatings reduce the number of subsequent applications of foliar insecticide sprays and may derive an economic return. Our results inform the societal discussion on the pollinator costs and farming benefits of prophylactic neonicotinoid usage on a mass flowering crop.},

Population reductions have been documented for the agriculturally important honey bee (Apis mellifera), and other bee species such as bumble bees that are also critical for pollinating crops and natural landscapes. A variety of factors contribute to the observed population reductions, including exposure to agrochemicals. In recent decades, neonicotinoid pesticide use has dramatically increased, as have concerns regarding the safety of these chemicals for pollinator health. Here we assessed the toxicity of the neonicotinoid acetamiprid to the bumble bee Bombus impatiens, a species commercially available for use in agricultural settings in North America. Using the microcolony model, we examined nest growth, development and subsequent nest productivity as measured by drone production. We found that high concentrations of acetamiprid in syrup (11,300 μg/L) significantly impacted nest growth and development, and ultimately drone production, and exposure to 1,130 μg/L acetamiprid also significantly decreased drone production. The no observable adverse effect level was 113 μg/L. Overall, acetamiprid delivered in syrup can negatively impact B. impatiens nest development and productivity, however only at concentrations above which would be expected in the environment when used according to label rates.},

  abstract = {Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are ecologically and economically important pollinating insects and nutritional stress is one of the most significant factors causing their decline. However, our knowledge of the nutritional requirements of bumblebees is largely limited to just a small number of species that can be easily reared in the laboratory, so there is  an important need to understand the nutritional requirements of a greater range of bumblebee species. In particular, the long-tongued, pocket maker species that have been intractable to laboratory rearing, yet are often of greatest conservation concern. Here, we compare the development and success of incipient colonies in two species of pocket maker bumblebees (B. pascuorum and B. hortorum) when fed either a less diverse or more diverse pollen diet. Our results show that both diets were sufficiently good for queens of both species to rear workers, but they performed significantly better for some variables on the less diverse diet. Our findings support previous work that suggests that a less diverse diet can be as good as a highly diverse mix in some respects. We also observed significant differences between species, demonstrating why we must not rely only on one or two model species to understand the effects of nutritional stress on bumblebee communities.},

  abstract = {Bumblebees are important pollinating insects, but many species have suffered declines over the last century. Long-tongued bumblebees have been identified as particularly at risk, partly due to their more selective diet. Attempts to study these species in captivity have been impeded by stress-induced behaviours which cause queens to kill or abandon their brood. Here, we attempt to further develop techniques, using queen pairing and Bombus terrestris cocoons, to successfully rear two common long-tongued bumblebee species (B. pascuorum and B. hortorum ) in captivity. Approximately half of queens laid eggs and 29\% produced workers. Although challenges remain, there is a great deal to be gained from optimising the captive rearing of these species.},

  abstract = {Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme whose best-known function is to hydrolyze the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholinesterase is expressed in several noncholinergic tissues. Accordingly, we report for the first time the identification of acetylcholinesterase in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells. Here we further performed an electrophoretic and biochemical characterization of this enzyme, using protein extracts obtained by solubilization of human endothelial cell membranes with Triton X-100. These extracts were analyzed under polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of Triton X-100 and under nondenaturing conditions, followed by specific staining for cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase activity. The gels revealed one enzymatically active acetylcholinesterase band in the extracts that disappeared when staining was performed in the presence of eserine (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor). Performing western blotting with the C-terminal anti-acetylcholinesterase IgG, we identified a single protein band of approximately 70 kDa, the molecular mass characteristic of the human monomeric form of acetylcholinesterase. The western blotting with the N-terminal anti-acetylcholinesterase IgG antibody revealed a double band around 66–70 kDa. Using the Ellman's method to measure the cholinesterase activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, regarding its substrate specificity, we confirmed the existence of an acetylcholinesterase enzyme. Our studies revealed a predominance of acetylcholinesterase over other cholinesterases in human endothelial cells. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the existence of a membrane-bound acetylcholinesterase in human endothelial cells. In future studies, we will investigate the role of this protein in the endothelial vascular system.},

  abstract = {Foraging distance is a key determinant of colony survival and pollination potential in bumblebees Bombus spp. However this aspect of bumblebee ecology is poorly understood because of the difficulty in locating colonies of these central place foragers. Here, we used a combination of molecular microsatellite analyses, remote sensing and spatial analyses using kernel density estimates to estimate nest location and foraging distances for a large number of wild colonies of two species, and related these to the distribution of foraging habitats across an experimentally manipulated landscape. Mean foraging distances were 755 m for Bombus lapidarius and 775 m for B. pascuorum (using our most conservative estimation method). Colony-specific foraging distances of both species varied with landscape structure, decreasing as the proportion of foraging habitats increased. This is the first time that foraging distance in wild bumblebees has been shown to vary with resource availability. Our method offers a means of estimating foraging distances in social insects, and informs the scale of management required to conserve bumblebee populations and enhance their pollination services across different landscapes.},

  abstract = {Due to its expansion, agriculture has become increasingly dependent on the use of pesticides. However, the indiscriminate use of insecticides has had additional effects on the environment. These products have a broad spectrum of action, and therefore the insecticide affects not only the pests but also non-target insects such as bees, which are important pollinators of agricultural crops and natural environments. Among the most used pesticides, the neonicotinoids are particularly harmful. One of the neonicotinoids of specific concern is thiamethoxam, which is used on a wide variety of crops and is toxic to bees. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the effects of this insecticide in the midgut and Malpighian tubule cells of Africanized Apis mellifera. Newly emerged workers were exposed until 8 days to a diet containing a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam equal to 1/10 of LC50 (0.0428 ng a.i./l L of diet). The bees were dissected and the organs were processed for transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that thiamethoxam is cytotoxic to midgut and Malpighian tubules. In the midgut, the damage was more evident in bees exposed to the insecticide on the first day. On the eighth day, the cells were ultrastructurally intact suggesting a recovery of this organ. The Malpighian tubules showed pronounced alterations on the eighth day of exposure of bees to the insecticide. This study demonstrates that the continuous exposure to a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam can impair organs that are used during the metabolism of the insecticide. Microsc. Res.

  abstract = {Bumblebees of Bombus terrestris are indispensible pollinators for ecosystems and for various agricultural crops. Unfortunately, bumblebees are challenged by various stress factors including insecticide applications. Today sublethal effects of various insecticides need to be thoroughly investigated to allow their combined use with pollinators and other beneficial organisms. In this study, we used lambda-cyhalothrin as a model pyrethroid insecticide and investigated lethal and sublethal effects by different dilutions, ranging from 1/10 to 1/100 of its maximum field recommended dosage (MFRC, 37.5~ppm), with the use of a chronic toxicity tests in the laboratory and in flight cages in the greenhouse. In the laboratory, small microcolonies with five bumblebee workers with one being pseudo-queen were used, while in the greenhouse we used queen-right mini-hives where the bumblebees need to fly for pyrethroid-contaminated food. We observed strong sublethal effects in the laboratory with treatments of 1/10 and 1/20 of the MFRC: the nest reproduction was reduced by 49 and 32~\%, respectively, and the sugar water consumption by 36~\%. With free-flying bumblebees, the toxic effects at 1/10 of the MFRC were more pronounced. A mortality of 88~±~8~\% was observed after only 2~weeks, being twice the mortality in the laboratory microcolonies test (43~±~11~\%). Besides, it should be mentioned that in the greenhouse experiment all queens were dead and most of the workers showed signs of incoordination and convulsion and gradually became apathetic. In conclusion, our results demonstrated the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin with a range of lethal and sublethal effects, both crucial for the development and survival of the B. terrestris colonies. Moreover, this study supports the demand to test insecticide compounds on their safety, especially when the bees have to perform complex tasks such as foraging for their food.},

  abstract = {Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) is a widespread RNA virus of honey bees that has been linked with colony losses. Here we describe the transmission, prevalence, and genetic traits of this virus, along with host transcriptional responses to infections. Further, we present RNAi-based strategies for limiting an important mechanism used by IAPV to subvert host defenses. Our study shows that IAPV is established as a persistent infection in honey bee populations, likely enabled by both horizontal and vertical transmission pathways. The phenotypic differences in pathology among different strains of IAPV found globally may be due to high levels of standing genetic variation. Microarray profiles of host responses to IAPV infection revealed that mitochondrial function is the most significantly affected biological process, suggesting that viral infection causes significant disturbance in energy-related host processes. The expression of genes involved in immune pathways in adult bees indicates that IAPV infection triggers active immune responses. The evidence that silencing an IAPV-encoded putative suppressor of RNAi reduces IAPV replication suggests a functional assignment for a particular genomic region of IAPV and closely related viruses from the Family Dicistroviridae, and indicates a novel therapeutic strategy for limiting multiple honey bee viruses simultaneously and reducing colony losses due to viral diseases. We believe that the knowledge and insights gained from this study will provide a new platform for continuing studies of the IAPV–host interactions and have positive implications for disease management that will lead to mitigation of escalating honey bee colony losses worldwide.},

All neonicotinoids led to significant alteration (mainly down-regulation) of gene expression, generally with a concentration-dependent effect. Among many others, genes related to metabolism and detoxification were differently expressed. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of biological processes revealed catabolic carbohydrate metabolism (regulation of enzyme activities such as amylase), lipid metabolism, and transport mechanisms as shared terms between all neonicotinoids at high concentrations. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that at least two neonicotinoids induced changes in expression of various metabolic pathways: pentose phosphate pathways, starch and sucrose metabolism, and sulfur metabolism, in which glucose 1-dehydrogenase and alpha-amylase were down-regulated and 3'(2'), 5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase was up-regulated. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the down-regulation of major royal jelly proteins, hbg3, and cyp9e2 found by RNA-seq. Our study highlights the comparative molecular effects of neonicotinoid exposure to bees. Further studies should link these effects with physiological outcomes for a better understanding of effects of neonicotinoids.},

  abstract = {Neonicotinoid insecticides have been studied as possible contributors to bumble bee declines in North America and Europe. This has potential significance in corn agro-ecosystems since this crop is frequently treated with neonicotinoids and dominates much of the agricultural landscape in North America and Europe where bumble bees and other pollinators are commonplace. We conducted an experiment where commercial bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) hives were placed during pollen shed next to corn (Zea mays) fields that were grown from “conventional” seed that was treated with neonicotinoids, or “organic” seed that was not treated with pesticides. Samples of pollen were collected from corn plants for neonicotinoid residue analysis, pollen types carried by worker bees returning to hives were determined, and in autumn hives were dissected to measure various endpoints that serve as markers of colony vigor. Clothianidin was detected (0.1–0.8~ng/g) in pollen collected from all conventional fields, but was not detected in pollen from organic fields. Corn pollen was only rarely collected from bumble bee foragers and the vast majority of pollen was from wild plants around the corn fields. All hives appeared healthy and neonicotinoid seed treatments had no effect on any hive endpoints measured, except the number of workers, where significantly fewer workers were recovered from hives placed next to conventional fields (96~±~15 workers per hive) compared to organic fields (127~±~17 workers per hive). The results suggest that exposure during pollen shed to corn grown from neonicotinoid-treated shed poses low risk to B. impatiens.},

  abstract = {Nicotine, the main tobacco alkaloid leading to smoking dependence, rapidly crosses the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to become concentrated in the brain. Recently, it has been shown that nicotine interacts with some organic cation transporters (OCT), but their influence at the BBB has not yet been assessed in vivo. In this study, we characterized the transport of nicotine at the mouse luminal BBB by in situ brain perfusion. Its influx was saturable and followed the Michaelis–Menten kinetics (Km\,=\,2.60~mM, Vmax\,=\,37.60~nmol/s/g at pH~7.40). At its usual micromolar concentrations in the plasma, most (79\%) of the net transport of nicotine at the BBB was carrier-mediated, while passive diffusion accounted for 21\%. Studies on knockout mice showed that the OCT Oct1–3, P-gp, and Bcrp did not alter [3H]-nicotine transport at the BBB. Neither did inhibiting the transporters Mate1, Octn, or Pmat. The in vivo manipulation of intracellular and/or extracellular pH, the chemical inhibition profile, and the trans-stimulation experiments demonstrated that the nicotine transporter at the BBB shared the properties of the clonidine/proton antiporter. The molecular features of this proton-coupled antiporter have not yet been identified, but it also transports diphenhydramine and tramadol and helps nicotine cross the BBB at a faster rate and to a greater extent. The pharmacological inhibition of this nicotine/proton antiporter could represent a new strategy to reduce nicotine uptake by the brain and thus help curb addiction to smoking.},

  abstract = {In yeasts, the plasma membrane forms the barrier that protects the cell from the outside world, but also gathers and keeps valuable compounds inside. Although it is often suggested that hydrophobic molecules surpass this checkpoint by simple diffusion, it now becomes evident that protein-facilitated transport mechanisms allow for selective import and export of triglycerides, fatty acids, alkanes, and sterols in yeasts. During biomass production, hydrophobic carbon sources enter and exit the cell efficiently in a strictly regulated manner that helps avoid toxicity. Furthermore, various molecules, such as yeast pheromones, secondary metabolites and xenobiotics, are exported to ensure cell–cell communication, or increase chances of survival. This review summarizes the current knowledge on how hydrophobic compounds interact with protein-facilitated transport systems on the plasma membrane and how selective import and export across the yeast plasma membrane is achieved. Both the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as unconventional yeasts are discussed.},

Larvae of known age and instar were taken from young colonies, in which they would have been reared as workers, and placed into groups of queenless workers. Under these conditions the critical age for caste determination was 5 days, during the second instar. Endocrine correlates of caste determination were obtained by determining pro®les of juvenile hormone titer and juvenile hormone biosynthesis, measured by chiral-speci®c radioimmunoassay and the in vitro radiochemical assay, respectively. By the middle of the second instar prospective queen larvae had signi®cantly higher rates of juvenile hormone biosynthesis and juvenile hormone titer than prospective worker larvae. Based on the coincidence of timing of both the critical period and the appearance of caste-speci®c juvenile hormone titer, we suggest that juvenile hormone plays a role in the mechanisms that control caste determination in B. terrestris.},

  abstract = {Social bees are important insect pollinators of wildflowers and agricultural crops, making their reported declines a global concern. A major factor implicated in these declines is the widespread use of neonicotinoid pesticides. Indeed, recent research has demonstrated that exposure to low doses of these neurotoxic pesticides impairs bee behaviours important for colony function and survival. However, our understanding of the molecular-genetic pathways that lead to such effects is limited, as is our knowledge of how effects may differ between colony members. To understand what genes and pathways are affected by exposure of bumblebee workers and queens to neonicotinoid pesticides, we implemented a transcriptome-wide gene expression study. We chronically exposed Bombus terrestriscolonies to either clothianidin or imidacloprid at field-realistic concentrations while controlling for factors including colony social environment and worker age. We reveal that genes involved in important biological processes including mitochondrial function are differentially expressed in response to neonicotinoid exposure. Additionally, clothianidin exposure had stronger effects on gene expression amplitude and alternative splicing than imidacloprid. Finally, exposure affected workers more strongly than queens. Our work demonstrates how RNA-Seq transcriptome profiling can provide detailed novel insight on the mechanisms mediating pesticide toxicity to a key insect pollinator.},

Pollen is essential to the bee’s diet, providing protein, lipids, and micronutrients. The dramatic shifts in physiology, anatomy, and behavior that accompany normal worker development are highly plastic and recent work demonstrates that development, particularly the transition from nurse to foraging roles, is greatly impacted by diet. However, the role that diet plays in the developmental transition of newly eclosed bees to nurse workers is poorly understood. To further understand honey bee nutrition and the role of diet in nurse development, we used a high-throughput screen of the transcriptome of 3~day and 8~day old worker bees fed either honey and stored pollen (rich diet) or honey alone (poor diet) within the hive. We employed a three factor (age, diet, age x diet) analysis of the transcriptome to determine whether diet affected nurse worker physiology and whether poor diet altered the developmental processes normally associated with aging.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Genetic interactions occur when mutations in two or more genes combine to generate an unexpected phenotype. An extreme negative or synthetic lethal genetic interaction occurs when two mutations, neither lethal individually, combine to cause cell death. Conversely, positive genetic interactions occur when two mutations produce a phenotype that is less severe than expected. Genetic interactions identify functional relationships between genes and can be harnessed for biological discovery and therapeutic target identification. They may also explain a considerable component of the undiscovered genetics associated with human diseases. Here, we describe construction and analysis of a comprehensive genetic interaction network for a eukaryotic cell. RATIONALE: Genome sequencing projects are providing an unprecedented view of genetic variation. However, our ability to interpret genetic information to predict inherited phenotypes remains limited, in large part due to the extensive buffering of genomes, making most individual eukaryotic genes dispensable for life. To explore the extent to which genetic interactions reveal cellular function and contribute to complex phenotypes, and to discover the general principles of genetic networks, we used automated yeast genetics to construct a global genetic interaction network. RESULTS: We tested most of the \textasciitilde 6000 genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for all possible pairwise genetic interactions, identifying nearly 1 million interactions, including \textasciitilde 550,000 negative and \textasciitilde 350,000 positive interactions, spanning \textasciitilde 90\% of all yeast genes. Essential genes were network hubs, displaying five times as many interactions as nonessential genes. The set of genetic interactions or the genetic interaction profile for a gene provides a quantitative measure of function, and a global network based on genetic interaction profile similarity revealed a hierarchy of modules reflecting the functional architecture of a cell. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections associated with defects in cell cycle progression or cellular proteostasis. Importantly, the global network illustrates how coherent sets of negative or positive genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathways to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell. CONCLUSION: A global genetic interaction network highlights the functional organization of a cell and provides a resource for predicting gene and pathway function. This network emphasizes the prevalence of genetic interactions and their potential to compound phenotypes associated with single mutations. Negative genetic interactions tend to connect functionally related genes and thus may be predicted using alternative functional information. Although less functionally informative, positive interactions may provide insights into general mechanisms of genetic suppression or resiliency. We anticipate that the ordered topology of the global genetic network, in which genetic interactions connect coherently within and between protein complexes and pathways, may be exploited to decipher genotype-to-phenotype relationships.},

  abstract = {Background The precise mode of action of sulfoxaflor, a new nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-modulating insecticide, is unclear. A detailed understanding of the mode of action, especially in relation to the neonicotinoids, is essential for recommending effective pest management practices. Results Radiolabel binding experiments using a tritiated analogue of sulfoxaflor ([3H]-methyl-SFX) performed on membranes from Myzus persicae demonstrate that sulfoxaflor interacts specifically with the high-affinity imidacloprid binding site present in a subpopulation of the total nAChR pool. In competition studies, imidacloprid-like neonicotinoids displace [3H]-methyl-SFX at pM concentrations. The effects of sulfoxaflor on the exposed aphid nervous system in situ are analogous to those of imidacloprid and nitenpyram, and finally the high-affinity sulfoxaflor binding site is absent in a Myzus persicae strain (clone FRC) possessing a single amino acid point mutation (R81T) in the β-nAChR, a region critical for neonicotinoid interaction. Conclusion The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor pharmacological profile of sulfoxaflor in aphids is consistent with that of imidacloprid. Additionally, the insecticidal activity of sulfoxaflor and the current commercialised neonicotinoids is affected by the point mutation in FRC Myzus persicae. Therefore, it is suggested that sulfoxalfor be considered a neonicotinoid, and that this be taken into account when recommending insecticide rotation partnering for effective resistance management programmes. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {Background The precise mode of action of sulfoxaflor, a new nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-modulating insecticide, is unclear. A detailed understanding of the mode of action, especially in relation to the neonicotinoids, is essential for recommending effective pest management practices. Results Radiolabel binding experiments using a tritiated analogue of sulfoxaflor ([3H]-methyl-SFX) performed on membranes from Myzus persicae demonstrate that sulfoxaflor interacts specifically with the high-affinity imidacloprid binding site present in a subpopulation of the total nAChR pool. In competition studies, imidacloprid-like neonicotinoids displace [3H]-methyl-SFX at pM concentrations. The effects of sulfoxaflor on the exposed aphid nervous system in situ are analogous to those of imidacloprid and nitenpyram, and finally the high-affinity sulfoxaflor binding site is absent in a Myzus persicae strain (clone FRC) possessing a single amino acid point mutation (R81T) in the β-nAChR, a region critical for neonicotinoid interaction. Conclusion The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor pharmacological profile of sulfoxaflor in aphids is consistent with that of imidacloprid. Additionally, the insecticidal activity of sulfoxaflor and the current commercialised neonicotinoids is affected by the point mutation in FRC Myzus persicae. Therefore, it is suggested that sulfoxalfor be considered a neonicotinoid, and that this be taken into account when recommending insecticide rotation partnering for effective resistance management programmes. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {In summer 2012, we initiated a large-scale field experiment in southern Ontario, Canada, to determine whether exposure to clothianidin seed-treated canola (oil seed rape) has any adverse impacts on honey bees. Colonies were placed in clothianidin seed-treated or control canola fields during bloom, and thereafter were moved to an apiary with no surrounding crops grown from seeds treated with neonicotinoids. Colony weight gain, honey production, pest incidence, bee mortality, number of adults, and amount of sealed brood were assessed in each colony throughout summer and autumn. Samples of honey, beeswax, pollen, and nectar were regularly collected, and samples were analyzed for clothianidin residues. Several of these endpoints were also measured in spring 2013. Overall, colonies were vigorous during and after the exposure period, and we found no effects of exposure to clothianidin seed-treated canola on any endpoint measures. Bees foraged heavily on the test fields during peak bloom and residue analysis indicated that honey bees were exposed to low levels (0.5–2 ppb) of clothianidin in pollen. Low levels of clothianidin were detected in a few pollen samples collected toward the end of the bloom from control hives, illustrating the difficulty of conducting a perfectly controlled field study with free-ranging honey bees in agricultural landscapes. Overwintering success did not differ significantly between treatment and control hives, and was similar to overwintering colony loss rates reported for the winter of 2012–2013 for beekeepers in Ontario and Canada. Our results suggest that exposure to canola grown from seed treated with clothianidin poses low risk to honey bees.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The effects of chronic exposure to two neonicotinoids (clothianidin and imidacloprid) and two organophosphates (chlorpyrifos and dimethoate) on survival, developmental rate and larval weight of honey bee larvae reared in vitro were determined. Diets containing chemicals were fed to larvae with the range of concentrations for each compound based on published acute toxicity experiments and residues found in pollen and nectar, both components of the larval diet. RESULTS Four concentrations of each compound and controls were tested: chlorpyrifos: 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 8 mg/L; clothianidin: 0.1, 0.4, 2, 10 mg L−1; dimethoate: 0.02, 1, 6, 45 mg L−1; imidacloprid: 0.4, 2, 4, 10 mg L−1; positive control: dimethoate (45 mg L−1); solvent control: acetone or methanol; and negative control. A significant decrease in survival, relative to the solvent control, occurred in the 0.8, 1.2 and 8 mg L−1 chlorpyrifos, 0.4, 2 and 10 mg L−1 clothianidin, and 45 mg L−1 dimethoate diets, but not the imidacloprid diets. CONCLUSION The treatment of larval diets with clothianidin, dimethoate and imidacloprid did not affect survival, developmental rate, or weight of immature honey bees; however, treatment with chlorpyrifos did. Overall, our results are valuable for evaluating the chronic toxicity of these pesticides to developing honey bees. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {There is a pressing need to better understand the factors contributing to declines of wild pollinators such as bumblebees. Many different contributors have been postulated including: loss of flower-rich habitats and nesting sites; monotonous diets; impacts of invasive pathogens; exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids. Past research has tended to investigate the impacts of these stressors in isolation, despite the increasing recognition that bees are simultaneously exposed to a combination of stressors, with potentially additive or synergistic effects. No studies to date have investigated the combined effects of a monotonous diet and exposure to pesticides. Using queenless micro-colonies of Bombus terrestris audax, we examined this interaction by providing bees with monofloral or polyfloral pollen that was either contaminated with field-realistic levels of thiamethoxam, a commonly used neonicotinoid, or not contaminated. Both treatments were found to have a significant effect on various parameters relating to micro-colony performance. Specifically, both pesticide-treated micro-colonies and those fed monofloral pollen grew more slowly than those given polyfloral pollen or pollen without pesticides. The two factors appeared to act additively. Micro-colonies given monofloral pollens also exhibited lower reproductive efforts and produced smaller drones. Although further research is needed to examine whether similar effects are found in whole colonies, these findings increase our understanding of the likely effects of multiple stressors associated with agricultural intensification on bee declines.},

  abstract = {To sustain the quantity and quantity to fulfill the increased food demand of the rapidly growing population, agricultural industry plays an important role in the survival of nations. The agricultural industry has undertaken numerous scientific innovations to make it highly efficient and sustainable. However, if such improvements have resulted in enhanced yields, they have concurrently also triggered the degradation of the environment. One such problem is posed by organophosphate pesticides that are being extensively utilized in agricultural practices and other activities because of their greater efficiency and lesser environmental persistence. But utilization of these pesticides poses a threat to the environment because of their toxic nature and persistence in the food chain. Residues of these pesticides usually get build up in the upper surface of the soil and ultimately find their way into the food products. Once consumed by the humans and other living organisms, these pesticides affect not only them but also the population of various groups of soil microbes and their biochemical activities in the soil. Bacteria, fungi, and plants have demonstrated the capability to degrade these pesticides from the environment. Hence, bioremediation has been considered as an attractive, potentially appropriate, efficient, cost-effective, and an eco-friendly method for decontamination of pesticide-contaminated sites. Therefore, in this chapter, an attempt has been made to provide an overview of various types of pesticides, followed by analyzing the impacts of organophosphates, their toxicological mechanism, pollution status, and biodegradation in the environment.},

Mutationspdr3-1 andpdr3-2, which confer resistance to several antibiotics can be complemented by a wild-type allele of the PDR3 gene. The sequence of the wild-typePDR3 gene revealed the presence of a long open reading frame capable of encoding a 976-amino acid protein. The protein contains a single Zn(II)2Cys6 binuclear-type zinc finger homologous to the DNA-binding motifs of other transcriptional activators from lower eukaryotes. Evidence that the PDR3 protein is a transcriptional activator was provided by demonstrating that DNA-bound LexA-PDR3 fusion proteins stimulate expression of a nearby promoter containing LexA binding sites. The use of LexA-PDR3 fusions revealed that the protein contains two activation domains, one localised near the N-terminal, cysteine-rich domain and the other localised at the C-terminus. The salient feature of the PDR3 protein is its similarity to the protein coded byPDR1, a gene responsible forpleiotropicdrugresistance. The two proteins show 36\% amino acid identity over their entire length and their zinc finger DNA-binding domains are highly conserved. The fact that the absence of both PDR1 and PDR3 (simultaneous disruption of the two genes) enhances multidrug sensitivity strongly suggests that the two transcriptional factors have closely related functions.},

Our results showed that the susceptibility varied significantly with the type of exposure (ingestion, topical, or contact), and there were significant differences between species. While M. quadrifasciata was usually more susceptible to insecticides (except for abamectin) in realistic exposures (via ingestion and contact) than A. mellifera, the former was less susceptible than A. mellifera to topically applied insecticides, a less realistic means of insecticide exposure. These findings challenge the common extrapolation of toxicity bioassays with A. mellifera to all (native) bee pollinators. Such equivocated extrapolation may compromise the significant services provided by native bees in Neotropical ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The survival of a species depends on its capacity to adjust to changing environmental conditions, and new stressors. Such new, anthropogenic stressors include the neonicotinoid class of crop-protecting agents, which have been implicated in the population declines of pollinating insects, including honeybees (Apis mellifera). The low-dose effects of these compounds on larval development and physiological responses have remained largely unknown. Over a period of 15 days, we provided syrup tainted with low levels (2 µg/L−1) of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid to beehives located in the field. We measured transcript levels by RNA sequencing and established lipid profiles using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry from worker-bee larvae of imidacloprid-exposed (IE) and unexposed, control (C) hives. Within a catalogue of 300 differentially expressed transcripts in larvae from IE hives, we detect significant enrichment of genes functioning in lipid-carbohydrate-mitochondrial metabolic networks. Myc-involved transcriptional response to exposure of this neonicotinoid is indicated by overrepresentation of E-box elements in the promoter regions of genes with altered expression. RNA levels for a cluster of genes encoding detoxifying P450 enzymes are elevated, with coordinated downregulation of genes in glycolytic and sugar-metabolising pathways. Expression of the environmentally responsive Hsp90 gene is also reduced, suggesting diminished buffering and stability of the developmental program. The multifaceted, physiological response described here may be of importance to our general understanding of pollinator health. Muscles, for instance, work at high glycolytic rates and flight performance could be impacted should low levels of this evolutionarily novel stressor likewise induce downregulation of energy metabolising genes in adult pollinators.},

Recent studies in flies and mammalian tissue culture cells have elucidated many signalling components upstream of TOR complex 1.

  abstract = {The cell wall of a yeast cell forms a barrier for various proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous molecules. Nisin, a small polypeptide and a well-known preservative active against gram-positive bacteria, was tested with wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This peptide had no effect on intact cells. However, removal of the cell wall facilitated access of nisin to the membrane and led to cell rupture. The roles of individual components of the cell wall in protection against nisin were studied by using synchronized cultures. Variation in nisin sensitivity was observed during the cell cycle. In the S phase, which is the phase in the cell cycle in which the permeability of the yeast wall to fluorescein isothiocyanate dextrans is highest, the cells were most sensitive to nisin. In contrast, the cells were most resistant to nisin after a peak in expression of the mRNA of cell wall protein 2 (Cwp2p), which coincided with the G2 phase of the cell cycle. A mutant lacking Cwp2p has been shown to be more sensitive to cell wall-interfering compounds and Zymolyase (J. M. Van der Vaart, L. H. Caro, J. W. Chapman, F. M. Klis, and C. T. Verrips, J. Bacteriol. 177:3104–3110, 1995). Here we show that of the single cell wall protein knockouts, a Cwp2p-deficient mutant is most sensitive to nisin. A mutant with a double knockout of Cwp1p and Cwp2p is hypersensitive to the peptide. Finally, in yeast mutants with impaired cell wall structure, expression of both CWP1 and CWP2 was modified. We concluded that Cwp2p plays a prominent role in protection of cells against antimicrobial peptides, such as nisin, and that Cwp1p and Cwp2p play a key role in the formation of a normal cell wall.},

By dint of CD spectra and synchronous fluorescence, it was clear that the orderly weak interactions between amino acid residues within globular proteins were disturbed by imidacloprid, and this event led to marginally alterations or self-regulations of protein conformation so as to lodge imidacloprid more tightly. Both steady state and time-resolved fluorescence suggested that the fluorescence of Trp residues in proteins was quenched after the presence of imidacloprid, corresponding to noncovalent protein–imidacloprid complexes formation and, the reaction belongs to moderate association (K=1.888/1.614×104M−1 for albumin/hemoglobin-imidacloprid, respectively), hydrogen bonds and π stacking performed a vital role in stabilizing the complexes, as derived from thermodynamic analysis and molecular modeling. With the aid of hydrophobic ANS experiments, subdomain IIA and α1β2 interface of albumin and hemoglobin, respectively, were found to be preserved high-affinity for imidacloprid. These results ties in with the subsequently molecular modeling laying imidacloprid in the Sudlow’s site I and close to Trp-213 residue on albumin, while settling down B/Trp-37 residue nearby in hemoglobin, and these conclusions further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulation. But, at the same time, several crucial noncovalent bonds came from other amino acid residues, e.g. Arg-194 and Arg-198 (albumin) and B/Arg-40, B/Asp-99 and B/Asn-102 (hemoglobin) cannot be ignored completely. Based on the comparative studies of binding modes between imidacloprid and its two primary metabolites with globular proteins, it is evident to us that the noncovalent interactions of 6-chloronicotinic acid and 2-imidazolidone with biopolymers are not always to be decreased obviously as a result of the relatively small molecular structures of these metabolites, compared with parent compound imidacloprid. Conversely, this could probably strengthen the weak interactions existed in the macromolecules-metabolites conjugation, or rather, the metabolites such as 6-chloronicotinic acid and 2-imidazolidone contributed drastically to the overall toxicity of imidacloprid.},

  abstract = {Clothianidin is a widely used neonicotinoid insecticide, which is a potent agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in insects. This neurotoxic compound has a negative impact on insect immunity, as it down-regulates the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Given the evolutionary conserved role of NF-κB in the modulation of the immune response in the animal kingdom, here we want to assess any effect of Clothianidin on vertebrate defense barriers. In presence of this neonicotinoid insecticide, a pro-inflammatory challenge with LPS on the human monocytic cell line THP-1 results both in a reduced production of the cytokine TNF-α and in a down-regulation of a reporter gene under control of NF-κB promoter. This finding is corroborated by a significant impact of Clothianidin on the transcription levels of different immune genes, characterized by a core disruption of TRAF4 and TRAF6 that negatively influences NF-κB signaling. Moreover, exposure to Clothianidin concurrently induces a remarkable up-regulation of NGFR, which supports the occurrence of functional ties between the immune and nervous systems. These results suggest a potential risk of immunotoxicity that neonicotinoids may have on vertebrates, which needs to be carefully assessed at the organism level.},

  abstract = {Drug entry into cells was previously believed to be via diffusion through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, with the contribution to uptake by transporter proteins being of only marginal importance. Now, however, drug uptake is understood to be mainly transporter-mediated. This suggests that uptake transporters may be a major determinant of idiosyncratic drug response and a site at which drug-drug interactions occur. Accurately modelling drug pharmacokinetics is a problem of Systems Biology and requires knowledge of both the transporters with which a drug interacts and where those transporters are expressed in the body. Current physiology-based pharmacokinetic models mostly attempt to model drug disposition from the biophysical properties of the drug, drug uptake by diffusion being thereby an implicit assumption. It is clear that the incorporation of transporter proteins and their drug interactions into such models will greatly improve them. We discuss methods by which tissue localisations and transporter interactions can be determined. We propose a yeast-based transporter expression system for the initial screening of drugs for their cognate transporters. Finally, the central importance of computational modelling of transporter substrate preferences by structure-activity relationships is discussed.},

  abstract = {A pivotal role for excitotoxicity in neurodegenerative diseases is gaining increasingly more acceptance, but the underlying mechanisms through which it participates in neurodegeneration still need further investigation. Excessive activation of glutamate receptors by excitatory amino acids leads to a number of deleterious consequences, including impairment of calcium buffering, generation of free radicals, activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition and secondary excitotoxicity. Recent studies implicate excitotoxicity in a variety of neuropathological conditions, suggesting that neurodegenerative diseases with distinct genetic etiologies may share excitotoxicity as a common pathogenic pathway. Thus, understanding the pathways involved in excitotoxicity is of critical importance for the future clinical treatment of many neurodegenerative diseases. This review discusses the current understanding of excitotoxic mechanisms and how they are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.},

Thereby, we identified common and unique molecular responses of a model host species, the honey bee (Apis mellifera), to its major pathogens and parasites: the Microsporidia Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae, RNA viruses, and the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, which transmits viruses.},

  abstract = {Answers were sought to three questions to the regulation of oogenesis and ovipositions by the bumblebee queen and by her workers: a) Which factors have an effect on oogenesis and subsequent ovipositions at the individual level? b) What impact do social factors and the presence of the queen have on ovary activation and egg laying by workers at colony level? c) Is oogenesis in workers related to egg laying by the queen, particularly to her switch from laying diploid, female biased eggs to haploid, male producing eggs? When workers emerge, in queenright colonies, their ovaries start to develop and become increasingly up to the age of about 10 days. By that time about 40\% of the bees contain ripe eggs, whereas in the other bees the oocytes remain in an intermediate stage. Neither developmental time from egg to adult nor body size has an influence in determining which workers will develop mature eggs and which will not. In adult bees the frequency of feeding larvae or the activity of the hypopharyngeal gland are not related to ovarian activity. The ovaries of bees that have no access to pollen do not develop, and the fat bodies of these bees are relatively small. Foraging in the field is correlated with low ovarian activity. However, bees that once were foragers can become laying workers later on in life, especially if they belong to the first and second brood. Social interactions between workers or between a worker and a queen stimulate activity, leading to activation of the ovaries. The queen, however, also has a slight inhibitory effect, so that in workers aged 5–8 days ovarian activity is lower than in queenless groups. In older bees from queenright groups ovarian activity levels are almost the same as in groups of queenless workers. In queenless groups some of the workers lay eggs from the age of 7 days onwards, whereas in colonies and queenright groups the queen prevents all worker ovipositions for about 31 days. The queen, therefore, has two different effects on the reproductive characteristics of the worker, a physiological one and a behavioural one. Ovarian development levels in the worker population do not affect the switch of the queen to the laying of haploid eggs, nor does this switch has any influence on the degree of ovarian activity of the worker population later on. There is also no relation between the moment of the switch and the occurrence of worker ovipositions. Résumé Etude du développement ovarien et de la ponte des ouvrières de Bombus terrestris Nous avons cherché à répondre aux trois questions suivantes concernant la régulation de l'ovo-genèse et la ponte des reines et des ouvrières: a) quels facteurs influencent l'ovogenèse et la ponte consécutive, au niveau individuel? b) Quel est l'impact des facteurs sociaux et de la présence de la reine sur l'activité ovarienne et la ponte des ouvrières, au niveau de la colonie? c) Est-ce que l'ovogenèse des ouvrières est liée à la ponte des reines, particulièrement lorsqu'elle passe d'une ponte en majorité à œufs diploïdes femelles, à une ponte à öufs haploïdes mâles? Quand les ouvrières naissant dans une colonie normale, leurs ovaires se développent jusqu'à 10 jours. A ce moment, environ 40\% des abeilles contiennent des œufs mûrs, tandis que les ovocytes des autres sont à un état intermédiaire. Ni la durée du développement de l'œuf à l'adulte, ni la taille du corps n'interviennent pour déterminer quelle ouvrière produira des œufs ou pas. Chez les abeilles adultes, la fréquence d'alimentation des larves et l'activité de la glande hypopharyngienne n'ont aucune relation avec l'activité ovarienne. Les ovaires des abeilles qui n'ont pas de contact avec le pollen ne se développent pas, et le corps gras de ces abeilles est relativement petit. La prospection dans la nature est liée à une faible activité ovarienne; cependant des abeilles qui ont été prospectrices peuvent devenir ultérieurement des ouvrières pondeuses surtout si elles appartiennent à la première ou à la seconde couvée. Les interactions sociales entre ouvrières ou entre reine et ouvrières stimulent l'activité, entraînant une activation des ovaires. Cependant, la reine a un léger effet inhibiteur, tel que l'activité ovarienne des ouvrières de 5–8 jours est plus faible que dans les groupes sans reine. Cependant, les vieilles abeilles des groupes avec reine ont une activité ovarienne presque aussi élevée que celles des groupes sans reine. Dans les groupes sans reine certaines ouvrières pondent à partir du septième jour, tandis que dans les colonies avec reine, cette dernière inhibe la ponte des ouvrières jusqu'à 30 jours. Par conséquent, la reine a deux effets différents sur la reproduction des ouvrières: un effet physiologique et un effet comportemental. Le niveau ovarien des ouvrières est sans effet sur le passage de la reine à la ponte d'œufs haploïdes, de même que ce passage n'aura pas d'influence sur l'activité ovarienne ultérieure des ouvrières. Il n'y a de même aucune relation entre le moment de ce passage à la ponte haploïde et l'apparition de pontes chez les ouvrières.},

  abstract = {Imidacloprid is the most important example of the neonicotinoid insecticides known to target the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in insects, and potentially in mammals. In the present study, oxidant and inflammatory responses to chronic exposure of imidacloprid was studied in rats. Wistar rats were randomly allocated into two groups as control and imidacloprid-exposed group (n=10rat/each group). 1mg/kg/BW/day imidacloprid was administrated orally by gavage for 30days. After exposure, rats were euthanized and liver and brain samples were surgically removed for analyses. Imidacloprid application caused a significant increase in nitric oxide production in brain (p{$<$}0.05) and liver (p{$<$}0.001). The quantitative analyses of mRNA confirmed the finding that imidacloprid induced the mRNA transcriptions of the three isoforms of nitric oxide synthases (iNOS, eNOS, nNOS) in brain and two isoforms (iNOS, eNOS) in the liver. Exposure to imidacloprid caused significant lipid peroxidation in plasma, brain (p{$<$}0.001) and liver (p{$<$}0.003). While the superoxide-generating enzyme xanthine oxidase activity was elevated in both tissues (p{$<$}0.001), myeloperoxidase activity was increased only in the liver (p{$<$}0.001). Antioxidant enzyme activities showed various alterations following exposure, but a significantly depleted antioxidant glutathione level was detected in brain (p{$<$}0.008). Evidence of chronic inflammation by imidacloprid was observed as induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 and IFN-γ in the liver and brain. In conclusion, chronic imidacloprid exposure causes oxidative stress and inflammation by altering antioxidant systems and inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the liver and central nervous system of non-target organisms.},

Also, the protective effect of vitamin C (200mg/kg bw) 30min before or after administration of imidacloprid were investigated. The results demonstrated that the median lethal dose (LD50) of imidacloprid after 24h was 149.76mg/kg bw. The oral administration of 14.976mg/kg imidacloprid significantly caused elevation in LPO level and the activities of antioxidant enzymes including CAT, SOD, GPx and GST. However, G6PD activity remained unchanged, while the level of GSH content was decreased. In addition, the results showed that vitamin C might ameliorate imidacloprid-induced oxidative damage by decreasing LPO and altering antioxidant defense system in liver.

  abstract = {Calcium through NMDA receptors (NMDARs) is necessary for the long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength; however, NMDARs differ in several properties that can influence the amount of calcium influx into the spine. These properties, such as sensitivity to magnesium block and conductance decay kinetics, change the receptor's response to spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) protocols, and thereby shape synaptic integration and information processing. This study investigates the role of GluN2 subunit differences on spine calcium concentration during several STDP protocols in a model of a striatal medium spiny projection neuron (MSPN). The multi-compartment, multi-channel model exhibits firing frequency, spike width, and latency to first spike similar to current clamp data from mouse dorsal striatum MSPN. We find that NMDAR-mediated calcium is dependent on GluN2 subunit type, action potential timing, duration of somatic depolarization, and number of action potentials. Furthermore, the model demonstrates that in MSPNs, GluN2A and GluN2B control which STDP intervals allow for substantial calcium elevation in spines. The model predicts that blocking GluN2B subunits would modulate the range of intervals that cause long term potentiation. We confirmed this prediction experimentally, demonstrating that blocking GluN2B in the striatum, narrows the range of STDP intervals that cause long term potentiation. This ability of the GluN2 subunit to modulate the shape of the STDP curve could underlie the role that GluN2 subunits play in learning and development.},

  abstract = {Pollinating insects provide vital ecosystem services of enormous importance for economies and biodiversity. Yet, there is a concerning global trend of pollinator declines. Parasites and pesticides are among the suspected principle drivers of these declines. However, especially in the case of key wild pollinators, there are insufficient data on the relative impact of these individual environmental stressors and whether they interact to increase detrimental effects. Using a fully crossed factorial design, we investigated how laboratory exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, over a 9-week period and a prevalent trypanosome gut parasite Crithidia bombi affects various crucial colony traits of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We show that chronic dietary exposure from an early stage of colony development to doses of thiamethoxam and clothianidin that could be encountered in the field truncated worker production, reduced worker longevity and decreased overall colony reproductive success. Further, we demonstrate a significant interaction between neonicotinoid exposure and parasite infection on mother queen survival. The fate of the mother queen is intrinsically linked to colony success, and under combined pressure of parasite infection and neonicotinoid exposure, mother queen survival was lowest. This indicates increased detrimental effects of combined exposure on this crucial colony trait. Combined effects may be exacerbated in stressful natural environments where more pronounced parasite virulence is expected. Synthesis and applications. Our findings reiterate that dietary exposure to neonicotinoids can impact on bumblebee colony performance and fitness. The indication of combined negative effects of ecologically relevant pressures suggests additional adverse consequences for long-term population dynamics under complex field conditions. To help safeguard pollinator health, whole life-cycle fitness assessments, particularly for non-Apis bees, stringently incorporating chronic and sublethal side effects of pesticides, as well as interactions with common natural stressors, such as prevalent parasites, should be considered in the corresponding test guidelines.},

  abstract = {Bumblebees and other pollinators provide a vital ecosystem service for the agricultural sector. Recent studies however have suggested that exposure to systemic neonicotinoid insecticides in flowering crops has sub-lethal effects on the bumblebee workforce, and hence in reducing queen production. The mechanism behind reduced nest performance, however, remains unclear. Here we use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to test whether exposure to a low, field realistic dose (0.7~ppb in sugar water and 6~ppb in pollen) of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, reduces worker foraging efficiency. Whilst the nectar foraging efficiency of bees treated with imidacloprid was not significantly different than that of control bees, treated bees brought back pollen less often than control bees (40~\% of trips vs 63~\% trips, respectively) and, where pollen was collected, treated bees brought back 31~\% less pollen per hour than controls. This study demonstrates that field-realistic doses of these pesticides substantially impacts on foraging ability of bumblebee workers when collecting pollen, and we suggest that this provides a causal mechanism behind reduced queen production in imidacloprid exposed colonies.},

Malathion was administered intraperitoneally in the acute and chronic protocols in the doses of 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg malathion/kg. The results showed that LPO in brain increased in both protocols. The increased oxidative stress resulted in an increased in the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), observed in cortex, striatum in the acute malathion protocol and hippocampus in the chronic malathion protocol. Our results demonstrated that malathion induced oxidative stress and modulated SOD and CAT activity in selective brain regions.},

The present study aimed to assess the adverse effects of λ-cyh, on fatty acid (FA) composition, redox status, and the histopathology aspect of Venus verrucosa digestive gland under an exposure to a series of concentrations (100, 250 and 500 µg/L). An increase of saturated fatty acid (SFAs) levels and a decrease of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) content, mainly eicosapentaenoic (C20: 5n − 3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic (C22: 6n − 3, DHA) acids, were observed in λ-cyh-treated digestive gland. Moreover, our data indicated an alteration in arachidonic acid (C20:4n − 6, ARA) level. The exposure to the highest dose of λ-cyh promoted oxidative stress with an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP), metallothionein (MT) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels. A significant decrease in enzymatic (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)) and non-enzymatic (reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamin C and non-protein-SH (NPSH)) antioxidants was showed in treated groups. Moreover, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was inhibited with the increase in λ-cyh concentration. Our biochemicals results have been confirmed by the histopathological observations. Overall, our results indicated the toxic effect of λ-cyh on the redox status of V. verrucosa digestive gland and highlighted the usefulness of determining FA composition in the better understanding of λ-cyh toxicity.},

In addition to the adult bees, larvae can be exposed to the insecticide through contaminated floral resources. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the possible effects of the exposure of A.~mellifera larvae to a field concentration of thiamethoxam (0.001~ng/μL thiamethoxam) on larval and pupal survival and on the percentage of adult emergence. Additionally, its cytotoxic effects on the digestive cells of midgut, Malpighian tubules cells and Kenyon cells of the brain of newly emerged A.~mellifera bees were analyzed. The results showed that larval exposure to this concentration of thiamethoxam did not influence larval and pupal survival or the percentage of adult bee emergence. However, this exposure caused ultra-structural alterations in the target and non-target organs of newly emerged bees. The digestive cell of bees that were exposed to the insecticide exhibited a basal labyrinth without long and thin channels and compromised mitochondria. In Malpighian tubules cells, disorganized basal labyrinth, dilated mitochondria with a deformed shape and a loss of cristae, and disorganized microvilli were observed. The results showed that the exposed bees presented Kenyon cells with alterations in the nucleus and mitochondria. These alterations indicate possible tissue degeneration, demonstrating the cytotoxicity of thiamethoxam in the target and non-target organs of newly emerged bees. Such results suggest cellular organelle impairment that can compromise cellular function of the midgut cells, Malpighian tubules cells and Kenyon cells, and, consequently, can compromise the longevity of the bees of the whole colony.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that pesticide exposure may be a contributing factor underlying the increased incidence of asthma in the United States and other industrialized nations. To test this hypothesis, airway hyperreactivity was measured in guinea pigs exposed to chlorpyrifos, a widely used organophosphate pesticide. Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves caused frequency-dependent bronchoconstriction that was significantly potentiated in animals 24 h or 7 days after a single subcutaneous injection of either 390 mg/kg or 70 mg/kg of chlorpyrifos, respectively. Mechanisms by which chlorpyrifos may cause airway hyperreactivity include inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) or dysfunction of M3 muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle or of autoinhibitory M2 muscarinic receptors on parasympathetic nerves in the lung. AChE activity in the lung was significantly inhibited 24 h after treatment with 390 mg/kg of chlorpyrifos, but not 7 days after injection of 70 mg/kg of chlorpyrifos. Acute exposure to eserine (250 μg/ml) also significantly inhibited lung AChE but did not potentiate vagally induced bronchoconstriction. Neuronal M2 receptor function was tested using the M2 agonist pilocarpine, which inhibits vagally induced bronchoconstriction in control animals. In chlorpyrifos-treated animals, pilocarpine dose-response curves were shifted significantly to the right, demonstrating decreased responsiveness of neuronal M2 receptors. In contrast, chlorpyrifos treatment did not alter methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction, suggesting that chlorpyrifos does not alter M3 muscarinic receptor function on airway smooth muscle. These data demonstrate that organophosphate insecticides can cause airway hyperreactivity in the absence of AChE inhibition by decreasing neuronal M2 receptor function.},

In fact, some studies show that various agrochemical ingredients possess mutagenic properties inducing mutations, chromosomal alterations or DNA damage. Experimental evidence shows a marked correlation between mutagenicity and carcinogenicity and indicates that short-term mutagenicity tests are useful for predicting carcinogenicity. The present study on rat exposed to two pyrethroids, cypermethrin and permethrin, showed different lymphocyte DNA damage depending on the type of pyrethroid, the dose, and the period of treatment. Data obtained from comet assay showed that oral treatment with 150mg/kg body weight/day of permethrin (corresponding to 1/10 of LD50) for 60 days, induced a significant increase in all comet parameters. No lymphocyte DNA damage was measured after treatment with 25mg/kg body weight/day of cypermethrin (corresponding to 1/10 of LD50) for the same period. A higher dose of permethrin (300mg/kg body weight/day), for a shorter period (22 days), did not induce lymphocyte DNA damage, while supplementation with 200mg/kg of Vitamins E and C protected erythrocytes against plasma membrane lipids peroxidation. Moreover, treatment with Vitamins E and C maintained the activity of glutathione peroxidase, which was reduced in the presence of permethrin, and reduced the osmotic fragility, which had increased following permethrin treatment.},

  abstract = {Populations of honey bees are declining throughout the world, with US beekeepers losing 30\% of their colonies each winter. Though multiple factors are driving these colony losses, it is increasingly clear that viruses play a major role. However, information about the molecular mechanisms mediating antiviral immunity in honey bees is surprisingly limited. Here, we examined the transcriptional and epigenetic (DNA methylation) responses to viral infection in honey bee workers. One-day old worker honey bees were fed solutions containing Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV), a virus which causes muscle paralysis and death and has previously been associated with colony loss. Uninfected control and infected, symptomatic bees were collected within 20–24 hours after infection. Worker fat bodies, the primary tissue involved in metabolism, detoxification and immune responses, were collected for analysis. We performed transcriptome- and bisulfite-sequencing of the worker fat bodies to identify genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation patterns associated with viral infection. There were 753 differentially expressed genes (FDR{$<$}0.05) in infected versus control bees, including several genes involved in epigenetic and antiviral pathways. DNA methylation status of 156 genes (FDR{$<$}0.1) changed significantly as a result of the infection, including those involved in antiviral responses in humans. There was no significant overlap between the significantly differentially expressed and significantly differentially methylated genes, and indeed, the genomic characteristics of these sets of genes were quite distinct. Our results indicate that honey bees have two distinct molecular pathways, mediated by transcription and methylation, that modulate protein levels and/or function in response to viral infections.},

Nicotine degradation by Arthrobacter nicotinovorans, a Gram-positive soil bacterium, is linked to the presence of the catabolic megaplasmid pAO1. l-[(14)C]Nicotine uptake assays with A. nicotinovorans showed transport of nicotine across the cell membrane to be energy-independent and saturable with a K(m) of 6.2+/-0.1 microM and a V(max) of 0.70+/-0.08 micromol min(-1) (mg protein)(-1). This is in accord with a mechanism of facilitated diffusion, driven by the nicotine concentration gradient. Nicotine uptake was coupled to its intracellular degradation, and an A. nicotinovorans strain unable to degrade nicotine (pAO1(-)) showed no nicotine import. However, when the nicotine dehydrogenase genes were expressed in this strain, import of l-[(14)C]nicotine took place. A. nicotinovorans pAO1(-) and Escherichia coli were also unable to import 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine, but expression of the 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine oxidase gene allowed both bacteria to take up this compound. l-Nicotine uptake was inhibited by d-nicotine, 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine and 2-amino-l-nicotine, which may indicate transport of these nicotine derivatives by a common permease. Attempts to correlate nicotine uptake with pAO1 genes possessing similarity to amino acid transporters failed. In contrast to the situation at the blood-brain barrier, nicotine transport across the cell membrane by these bacteria was not by passive diffusion or active transport but by facilitated diffusion.},

The levels of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and malondialdehyde (MDA) and the extent of DNA damage were measured to evaluate the toxicity of imidacloprid on zebrafish. SOD and GST activities were noticeably increased during early exposure but were inhibited toward the end of the exposure period. In addition, the CAT levels decreased to the control level following their elevation during early exposure. High concentrations of imidacloprid (1.25 and 5 mg/L) induced excessive ROS production and markedly increased MDA content on the 21st day of exposure. DNA damage was dose- and time-dependent. In conclusion, the present study showed that imidacloprid can induce oxidative stress and DNA damage in zebrafish.}

  abstract = {The adhesive interactions that occur between bone cells and the developing matrix during bone formation help guide coupled remodeling and the maintenance of bone mass. Here, we provide evidence that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a novel osteoblast-derived mediator of cell-matrix interactions in bone. These findings complement an increasing body of evidence which suggests that AChE, in addition to its role in terminating cholinergic signaling, may be instrumental in regulating cellular differentiation and adhesion. We have shown, using RT-PCR, that osteosarcoma cell lines and primary cultures of osteoblasts express AChE mRNA. Expression appeared to be differentiation-dependent, and restricted to AChE splice variants containing the T subunit (exon 6). Immunofluorescent localization demonstrated that these osteoblastic cells expressed protein for AChE with an intracellular vesicular distribution. Immunohistochemistry on tissue sections confirmed AChE expression by osteoblasts in vivo, and revealed the presence of AChE along cement lines, also identified by enzyme histochemistry. In vitro functional studies indicated that osteoblast-like cells adhered specifically to and spread on AChE substrates, but did not interact with butyrylcholinesterase, a closely related protein. Our evidence strongly implicates AChE as a novel bone matrix protein, capable of mediating cell-matrix interactions, and as such may be a principal participant in organized bone formation and the regulation of remodeling.},

  abstract = {Insect pollination is a vital ecosystem service that maintains biodiversity and sustains agricultural crop yields. Social bees are essential insect pollinators, so it is concerning that their populations are in global decline. Although pesticide exposure has been implicated as a possible cause for bee declines, we currently have a limited understanding of the risk these chemicals pose. Whilst environmental exposure to pesticides typically has non-lethal effects on individual bees, recent reports suggest that sublethal exposure can affect important behavioural traits such as foraging. However, at present, we know comparatively little about how natural foraging behaviour is impaired and the relative impacts of acute and chronic effects. Using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology, we examined how the day-to-day foraging patterns of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were affected when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and/or a pyrethroid (λ-cyhalothrin) independently and in combination over a four-week period. This is the first study to provide data on the impacts of combined and individual pesticide exposure on the temporal dynamics of foraging behaviour in the field over a prolonged period of time. Our results show that neonicotinoid exposure has both acute and chronic effects on overall foraging activity. Whilst foragers from control colonies improved their pollen foraging performance as they gained experience, the performance of bees exposed to imidacloprid became worse: chronic behavioural impairment. We also found evidence, suggesting that pesticide exposure can change forager preferences for the flower types from which they collect pollen. Our findings highlight the importance of considering prolonged exposure (which happens in the field) when assessing the risk that pesticides pose to bees. The effects of chronic pesticide exposure could have serious detrimental consequences for both colony survival and also the pollination services provided by these essential insect pollinators.},

  abstract = {Insect pollination is a vital ecosystem service that maintains biodiversity and sustains agricultural crop yields. Social bees are essential insect pollinators, so it is concerning that their populations are in global decline. Although pesticide exposure has been implicated as a possible cause for bee declines, we currently have a limited understanding of the risk these chemicals pose. Whilst environmental exposure to pesticides typically has non-lethal effects on individual bees, recent reports suggest that sublethal exposure can affect important behavioural traits such as foraging. However, at present, we know comparatively little about how natural foraging behaviour is impaired and the relative impacts of acute and chronic effects. Using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology, we examined how the day-to-day foraging patterns of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were affected when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and/or a pyrethroid (λ-cyhalothrin) independently and in combination over a four-week period. This is the first study to provide data on the impacts of combined and individual pesticide exposure on the temporal dynamics of foraging behaviour in the field over a prolonged period of time. Our results show that neonicotinoid exposure has both acute and chronic effects on overall foraging activity. Whilst foragers from control colonies improved their pollen foraging performance as they gained experience, the performance of bees exposed to imidacloprid became worse: chronic behavioural impairment. We also found evidence, suggesting that pesticide exposure can change forager preferences for the flower types from which they collect pollen. Our findings highlight the importance of considering prolonged exposure (which happens in the field) when assessing the risk that pesticides pose to bees. The effects of chronic pesticide exposure could have serious detrimental consequences for both colony survival and also the pollination services provided by these essential insect pollinators.},

Such effects may contribute to some of the toxic manifestations of OPs, particularly upon chronic or developmental exposures. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of oxidative stress in the neurotoxicity of two commonly used OPs, chlorpyrifos (CPF) and diazinon (DZ), their oxygen analogs (CPO and DZO), and their “inactive” metabolites (TCP and IMP), in neuronal cells from a genetic model of glutathione deficiency. Cerebellar granule neurons from wild type mice (Gclm +/+) and mice lacking the modifier subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (Gclm −/−), the first and limiting step in the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), were utilized. The latter display very low levels of GSH and are more susceptible to the toxicity of agents that increase oxidative stress. CPO and DZO were the most cytotoxic compounds, followed by CPF and DZ, while TCP and IMP displayed lower toxicity. Toxicity was significantly higher (10- to 25-fold) in neurons from Gclm (−/−) mice, and was antagonized by various antioxidants. Depletion of GSH from Gclm (+/+) neurons significantly increased their sensitivity to OP toxicity. OPs increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation and in both cases the effects were greater in neurons from Gclm (−/−) mice. OPs did not alter intracellular levels of GSH, but significantly increased those of oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Cytotoxicity was not antagonized by cholinergic antagonists, but was decreased by the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM. These studies indicate that cytotoxicity of OPs involves generation of reactive oxygen species and is modulated by intracellular GSH, and suggest that it may involve disturbances in intracellular homeostasis of calcium.},

The phenomenon showed increasing rates in the past years, although its causes are still awaiting a clear answer. Although neonicotinoid systemic insecticides used for seed coating of agricultural crops were suspected as possible reason, studies so far have not shown the existence of unquestionable sources capable of delivering directly intoxicating doses in the fields. Guttation is a natural plant phenomenon causing the excretion of xylem fluid at leaf margins. Here, we show that leaf guttation drops of all the corn plants germinated from neonicotinoid-coated seeds contained amounts of insecticide constantly higher than 10 mg/l, with maxima up to 100 mg/l for thiamethoxam and clothianidin, and up to 200 mg/l for imidacloprid. The concentration of neonicotinoids in guttation drops can be near those of active ingredients commonly applied in field sprays for pest control, or even higher. When bees consume guttation drops, collected from plants grown from neonicotinoid-coated seeds, they encounter death within few minutes.},

However, the source(s) of the ROS and their role in the increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) induced by NMDA receptor activation have not been firmly established. NADPH oxidase generates ROS in neurons, but there is no direct evidence that this enzyme is present in neurons containing NMDA receptors, or that is involved in NMDA receptor-dependent ROS production and CBF increase. We addressed these questions using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches. We found that the CBF and ROS increases elicited by topical application of NMDA to the mouse neocortex were both dependent on neuronal NO synthase (nNOS), cGMP, and the cGMP effector kinase protein kinase G (PKG). In mice lacking the NADPH oxidase subunit NOX2, the ROS increase was not observed, but the CBF increase was still present. Electron microscopy of the neocortex revealed NOX2 immunolabeling in postsynaptic somata and dendrites that also expressed the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit and nNOS. In neuronal cultures, the NMDA-induced increase in ROS was mediated by NADPH oxidase through NO, cGMP and PKG. We conclude that NADPH oxidase in postsynaptic neurons generates ROS during NMDA receptor activation. However, NMDA receptor-derived ROS do not contribute to the CBF increase. The findings establish a NOX2-containing NADPH oxidase as a major source of ROS produced by NMDA receptor activation, and identify NO as the critical link between NMDA receptor activity and NOX2-dependent ROS production.},

  abstract = {Among numerous factors that contribute to honey bee colony losses and problems in beekeeping, pesticides and Nosema ceranae have been often reported. In contrast to insecticides, whose effects on bees have been widely studied, fungicides did not attract considerable attention. Prochloraz, an imidazole fungicide widely used in agriculture, was detected in honey and pollen stored inside hives and has been already proven to alter immune gene expression of honey bees at different developmental stages. The aim of this study was to simulate the realistic conditions of migratory beekeeping, where colonies, both uninfected and infected with N. ceranae, are frequently transported to the vicinity of crop fields treated with prochloraz. We investigated the combined effect of prochloraz and N. ceranae on honey bees that faced fungicide during the larval stage through food consumption and microsporidium infection afterwards. The most pronounced changes in gene expression were observed in newly emerged Nosema-free bees originating from colonies previously contaminated with prochloraz. As exclusively upregulation was registered, prochloraz alone most likely acts as a challenge that induces activation of immune pathways in newly emerged bees. The combination of both stressors (prochloraz and Nosema infection) exerted the greatest effect on six-day-old honey bees. Among ten genes with significantly altered expression, half were upregulated and half downregulated. N. ceranae as a sole stressor had the weakest effects on immune gene expression modulation with only three genes significantly dysregulated. In conclusion, food contaminated with prochloraz consumed in larval stage could present a threat to the development of immunity and detoxification mechanisms in honey bees.},

  abstract = {Factors that determine the relative abundance of bumblebee species remain poorly understood, rendering management of rare and declining species difficult. Studies of bumblebee communities in the Americas suggest that there are strong competitive interactions between species with similar length tongues, and that this competition determines the relative abundance of species. In contrast, in Europe it is common to observe several short-tongued species coexisting with little or no evidence for competition shaping community structure. In this study we examine patterns of abundance and distribution in one of the most diverse bumblebee communities in Europe, found in the mountains of southern Poland. We quantify forage use when collecting nectar and pollen for 23 bumblebee species, and examine patterns of co-occurrence and niche overlap to determine whether there is evidence for inter-specific competition. We also test whether rarity can be explained by diet breadth. Up to 16 species were found coexisting within single sites, with species richness peaking in mountain pasture at \textasciitilde 1000m altitude. Results concur with previous studies indicating that the majority of pollen collected by bumblebees is from Fabaceae, but that some bee species (e.g. B. ruderatus) are much more heavily dependent on Fabaceae than others (e.g. B. lucorum). Those species that forage primarily on Fabaceae tended to have long tongues. In common with studies in the UK, diet breadth was correlated with abundance: rarer species tended to visit fewer flower species, after correcting for differences in sample size. No evidence was found for similarity in tongue length or dietary overlap influencing the likelihood of co-occurrence of species. However, the most abundant species (which co-occurred at most sites) occupied distinct dietary niche space. While species with tongues of similar length tended, overall, to have higher dietary niche overlap, among the group of abundant short-tongued species that commonly co-occurred there was marked dietary differentiation which may explain their coexistence.},

They act systemically, travelling through plant tissues and protecting all parts of the crop, and are widely applied as seed dressings. As neurotoxins with high toxicity to most arthropods, they provide effective pest control and have numerous uses in arable farming and horticulture. However, the prophylactic use of broad-spectrum pesticides goes against the long-established principles of integrated pest management (IPM), leading to environmental concerns. It has recently emerged that neonicotinoids can persist and accumulate in soils. They are water soluble and prone to leaching into waterways. Being systemic, they are found in nectar and pollen of treated crops. Reported levels in soils, waterways, field margin plants and floral resources overlap substantially with concentrations that are sufficient to control pests in crops, and commonly exceed the LC50 (the concentration which kills 50\% of individuals) for beneficial organisms. Concentrations in nectar and pollen in crops are sufficient to impact substantially on colony reproduction in bumblebees. Although vertebrates are less susceptible than arthropods, consumption of small numbers of dressed seeds offers a route to direct mortality in birds and mammals. Synthesis and applications.

  abstract = {Conserving pollinator services for crops If pollination fails, ecosystems are eroded and we will lose reliable sources of many critical foodstuffs. Focusing on the pollination services provided by bees, Goulson et al. review the stresses bees are experiencing from climate change, infectious diseases, and insecticides. We can mitigate some of the stress on bees by improving floral resources and adopting quarantine measures, and by surveillance of bee populations. Crucially, we need to resolve the controversy surrounding prophylactic use of pesticides. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1255957 Structured Abstract BACKGROUND The species richness of wild bees and other pollinators has declined over the past 50 years, with some species undergoing major declines and a few going extinct. Evidence of the causes of these losses is patchy and incomplete, owing to inadequate monitoring systems. Managed honey bee stocks have also declined in North America and many European countries, although they have increased substantially in China. During this same period, the demand for insect pollination of crops has approximately tripled, and the importance of wild pollinators in providing such services has become increasingly apparent, leading to concern that we may be nearing a “pollination crisis” in which crop yields begin to fall. This has stimulated much-needed research into the causes of bee declines. Habitat loss, which has reduced the abundance and diversity of floral resources and nesting opportunities, has undoubtedly been a major long-term driver through the 20th century and still continues today. In addition, both wild and managed bees have been exposed to a succession of emerging parasites and pathogens that have been accidentally moved around the world by human action. The intensification of agriculture and increasing reliance on pesticides means that pollinators are also chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals. Predicted changes in global climate are likely to further exacerbate such problems in the future. ADVANCES It has lately become clear that stressors do not act in isolation and that their interactions may be difficult to predict; for example, some pesticides act synergistically rather than additively. Both pesticide exposure and food stress can impair immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple interacting stressors is driving honey bee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators, but the precise combination apparently differs from place to place. Although the causes of pollinator decline may be complex and subject to disagreement, solutions need not be; taking steps to reduce or remove any of these stresses is likely to benefit pollinator health. Several techniques are available that have been demonstrated to effectively increase floral availability in farmland. Similarly, encouraging gardeners to grow appropriate bee-friendly flowers and to improve management of amenity grasslands can also reduce dietary stress. Retaining or restoring areas of seminatural habitat within farmland will improve nest site availability. A return to the principles of integrated pest management and avoidance of prophylactic use of agrochemicals could greatly decrease exposure of bees to pesticides. OUTLOOK Interactions among agrochemicals and stressors are not addressed by current regulatory procedures, which typically expose well-fed, parasite-free bees to a single pesticide for a short period of time. Devising approaches to study these interactions and incorporating them into the regulatory process poses a major challenge. In the meantime, providing support and advice for farmers in more sustainable farming methods with reduced pesticide use is likely to have broad benefits for farmland biodiversity. Enforcing effective quarantine measures on bee movements to prevent further spread of bee parasites is also vital. Finally, effective monitoring of wild pollinator populations is urgently needed to inform management strategies. Without this, we have no early warning system to tell us how close we may be to a pollination crisis. With a growing human population and rapid growth in global demand for pollination services, we cannot afford to see crop yields begin to fall, and we would be well advised to take preemptive action to ensure that we have adequate pollination services into the future. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6229/1255957/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Multiple interacting stressors drive bee declines. Both wild and managed bees are subject to a number of important and interacting stressors. For example, exposure to some fungicides can greatly increase the toxicity of insecticides, whereas exposure to insecticides reduces resistance to diseases. Dietary stresses are likely to reduce the ability of bees to cope with both toxins and pathogens. Photo credit: DAVE GOULSON Bees are subject to numerous pressures in the modern world. The abundance and diversity of flowers has declined; bees are chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals, and they are simultaneously exposed to novel parasites accidentally spread by humans. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these problems in the future. Stressors do not act in isolation; for example, pesticide exposure can impair both detoxification mechanisms and immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple interacting stressors is driving honey bee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators, but such interactions are not addressed by current regulatory procedures, and studying these interactions experimentally poses a major challenge. In the meantime, taking steps to reduce stress on bees would seem prudent; incorporating flower-rich habitat into farmland, reducing pesticide use through adopting more sustainable farming methods, and enforcing effective quarantine measures on bee movements are all practical measures that should be adopted. Effective monitoring of wild pollinator populations is urgently needed to inform management strategies into the future.},

In 2013 the UK’s Food \& Environment Research Agency made public a study of the impacts of exposure of bumblebee colonies to neonicotinoids. The study concluded that there was no clear relationship between colony performance and pesticide exposure, and the study was subsequently cited by the UK government in a policy paper in support of their vote against a proposed moratorium on some uses of neonicotinoids. Here I present a simple re-analysis of this data set. It demonstrates that these data in fact do show a negative relationship between both colony growth and queen production and the levels of neonicotinoids in the food stores collected by the bees. Indeed, this is the first study describing substantial negative impacts of neonicotinoids on colony performance of any bee species with free-flying bees in a field realistic situation where pesticide exposure is provided only as part of normal farming practices. It strongly suggests that wild bumblebee colonies in farmland can be expected to be adversely affected by exposure to neonicotinoids.},

  abstract = {To date, regulatory pesticide risk assessments have relied on the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) as a surrogate test species for estimating the risk of pesticide exposure to all bee species. However, honey bees and non-Apis bees may differ in their susceptibility and exposure to pesticides. In 2017, a workshop (‘Pesticide Exposure Assessment Paradigm for Non-Apis Bees’) was held to assess if honey bee risk assessment frameworks are reflective of non-Apis bee pesticide exposure. In this article, we summarize the workshop discussions on bumble bees (Bombus spp.). We review the life history and foraging behavior of bumble bees and honey bees and discuss how these traits may influence routes and levels of exposure for both taxa. Overall, the major pesticide exposure routes for bumble bees and honey bees are similar; however, bumble bees face additional exposure routes (direct exposure of foraging queens and exposure of larvae and adults to soil residues). Furthermore, bumble bees may receive comparatively higher pesticide doses via contact or oral exposure. We conclude that honey bee pesticide risk assessments may not always be protective of bumble bees, especially queens, in terms of exposure. Data needed to reliably quantify pesticide exposure for bumble bees (e.g., food consumption rates, soil residue levels) are lacking. Addressing these knowledge gaps will be crucial before bumble bee exposure can be incorporated into the pesticide risk assessment process. Because bumble bees exhibit appreciable interspecific variation in colony and behavioral characteristics, data relevant to pesticide exposure should be generated for multiple species.},

A number of dietary studies of up to 50 weeks duration have been conducted in order to identify the mode of action for the development of the liver tumors seen at the end of the cancer bioassay. Both thiamethoxam and its major metabolites have been tested in these studies. Over the duration of a 50-week thiamethoxam dietary feeding study in mice, the earliest change, within one week, is a marked reduction (by up to 40\%) in plasma cholesterol. This was followed 10 weeks later by evidence of liver toxicity including single cell necrosis and an increase in apoptosis. After 20 weeks there was a significant increase in hepatic cell replication rates. All of these changes persisted from the time they were first observed until the end of the study at 50 weeks. They occurred in a dose-dependent manner and were only observed at doses (500, 1250, 2500 ppm) where liver tumors were increased in the cancer bioassay. There was a clear no-effect level of 200 ppm. The changes seen in this study are consistent with the development of liver cancer in mice and form the basis of the mode of action. When the major metabolites of thiamethoxam, CGA322704, CGA265307, and CGA330050 were tested in dietary feeding studies of up to 20 weeks duration, only metabolite CGA330050 induced the same changes as those seen in the liver in the thiamethoxam feeding study. It was concluded that thiamethoxam is hepatotoxic and hepatocarcinogenic as a result of its metabolism to CGA330050. Metabolite CGA265307 was also shown to be an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase and to increase the hepatotoxicity of carbon tetrachloride. It is proposed that CGA265307, through its effects on nitric oxide synthase, exacerbates the toxicity of CGA330050 in thiamethoxam treated mice.},

  abstract = {The main objective of this study was to test comparatively the effects of two common insecticides on honey bee Apis mellifera worker’s lifespan, food consumption, mortality, and expression of antioxidant genes. Newly emerged worker bees were exposed to organophosphate insecticide coumaphos, a neonicotinoid imidacloprid, and their mixtures. Toxicity tests were conducted along with bee midgut immunohistological TUNEL analyses. RT-qPCR assessed the regulation of 10 bee antioxidant genes linked to pesticide toxicity. We tested coumaphos at 92,600 ppb concentration, in combination with 5 and 20 ppb imidacloprid. Coumaphos induced significantly higher bee mortality, which was associated with down regulation of catalase compared to coumaphos and imidacloprid (5/20 ppb) mixtures, whereas, both imidacloprid concentrations independently had no effect on bee mortality. Mixture of coumaphos and imidacloprid reduced daily bee consumption of a control food patty to 10\,mg from a coumaphos intake of 14.3\,mg and 18.4 and 13.7\,mg for imidacloprid (5 and 20) ppb, respectively. While coumaphos and imidacloprid mixtures induced down-regulation of antioxidant genes with noticeable midgut tissue damage, imidacloprid induced intensive gene up-regulations with less midgut apoptosis.},

  abstract = {Apart from its catalytic function in hydrolyzing acetylcholine, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) affects cell proliferation, differentiation and responses to various insults, including stress. These responses are at least in part specific to the three C-terminal variants of AChE which are produced by alternative splicing of the single ACHE gene. ‘Synaptic’ AChE-S constitutes the principal multimeric enzyme in brain and muscle; soluble, monomeric ‘readthrough’ AChE-R appears in embryonic and tumor cells and is induced under psychological, chemical and physical stress; and glypiated dimers of erythrocytic AChE-E associate with red blood cell membranes. We postulate that the homology of AChE to the cell adhesion proteins, gliotactin, glutactin and the neurexins, which have more established functions in nervous system development, is the basis of its morphogenic functions. Competition between AChE variants and their homologs on interactions with the corresponding protein partners would inevitably modify cellular signaling. This can explain why AChE-S exerts process extension from cultured amphibian, avian and mammalian glia and neurons in a manner that is C-terminus-dependent, refractory to several active site inhibitors and, in certain cases, redundant to the function of AChE-like proteins. Structural functions of AChE variants can explain their proliferative and developmental roles in blood, bone, retinal and neuronal cells. Moreover, the association of AChE excess with amyloid plaques in the degenerating human brain and with progressive cognitive and neuromotor deficiencies observed in AChE-transgenic animal models most likely reflects the combined contributions of catalytic and structural roles.},

Brain regions (pyriform cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus) were assayed for citrulline as the determinant of NO and for high-energy phosphates (ATP and phosphocreatine) as well as their major metabolites (ADP, AMP, and creatine). Rats, anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg i.p.), were killed using a head-focused microwave (power, 10 kW; duration, 1.7 s). Analyses of brain regions of controls revealed significantly higher levels of citrulline in the amygdala (289.8+/-7.0 nmol/g), followed by the hippocampus (253.8+/-5.5 nmol/g), and cortex (121.7+/-4.3 nmol/g). Levels of energy metabolites were significantly higher in cortex than in amygdala or hippocampus. Within 5 min of CF injection, the citrulline levels were markedly elevated in all three brain regions examined, while with DFP treatment, only the cortex levels were elevated at this time. With either acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, the maximum increase in citrulline levels was noted 30 min post-injection ({$>$} 6- to 7-fold in the cortex, and {$>$} 3- to 4-fold in the amygdala or hippocampus). Within 1 h following DFP or CF injection, marked declines in ATP (36-60\%) and phosphocreatine (28-53\%) were seen. Total adenine nucleotides and total creatine compounds were reduced (36 58\% and 28-48\%, respectively). The inverse relationship between the increase in NO and the decease in high-energy phosphates, could partly be due to NO-induced impaired mitochondrial respiration leading to depletion of energy metabolites. Pretreatment of rats with an antioxidant, the spin trapping agent N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN, 200 mg/kg i.p.), prevented DFP- or CF-induced seizures, while the antioxidant vitamin E (100 mg/kg i.p. per day for 3 days) had no anticonvulsant effect. Both antioxidants, however, significantly prevented the increase of citrulline and the depletion of high-energy phosphates. It is concluded that seizures induced by DFP and CF produce oxidative stress due to a marked increase in NO, causing mitochondrial dysfunction, and thereby depleting neuronal energy metabolites. PBN pretreatment provides protection against AChE inhibitor-induced oxidative stress mainly by preventing seizures. Additional antioxidant actions of PBN may contribute to its protective effects. Vitamin E has direct antioxidant effects by preventing excessive NO production.},

Tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) (detection frequency (DF), 77\%) and tributyl phosphate (TBP) (DF, 71\%), were the most frequently detected OPEs, while dibutyl phosphate (DBP) (DF, 84\%) and diphenyl phosphate (DPhP) (DF, 86\%) were the most frequently detected mOPEs. Vegetables had the highest concentrations of both ∑9OPEs and ∑11mOPEs, with the mean concentrations of 2.6 and 17 ng/g wet weight. Compared with dust ingestion and inhalation, dietary intake was the most important exposure pathway for tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) (4.1 ng/kg bw/day), TCIPP (25 ng/kg bw/day), and TBP (6.7 ng/kg bw/day), accounting for {$>$}75\% of total intake. Furthermore, we found that the intakes of some mOPEs, that is, bis(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (BDCIPP) and DPhP from diet were typically higher than that of their parent OPEs. Such high levels of mOPE intakes could interfere with the utilization of mOPEs as biomarkers for assessing OPE exposure and warrant further investigation.}

  abstract = {Due to intensive agriculture honeybees are threatened by various pesticides. The use of one group of them, the neonicotinoids, was recently restricted by the European Union. These chemicals bind to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) in the honeybee brain. Recently, Bayer AG released a new pesticide by the name of “Sivanto” against sucking insects. It is assumed to be harmless for honeybees, although its active ingredient, flupyradifurone, binds nAchR similar to the neonicotinoids. We investigated if this pesticide affects the taste for sugar and cognitive performance in honeybee foragers. These bees are directly exposed to the pesticide while foraging for pollen or nectar. Our results demonstrate that flupyradifurone can reduce taste and appetitive learning performance in honeybees foraging for pollen and nectar, although only the highest concentration had significant effects. Most likely, honeybee foragers will not be exposed to these high concentrations. Therefore, the appropriate use of this pesticide is considered safe for honeybees, at least with respect to the behaviors studied here.},

  abstract = {Honeybees and other pollinators are threatened by changing landscapes and pesticides resulting from intensified agriculture. In 2018 the European Union prohibited the outdoor use of three neonicotinoid insecticides due to concerns about pollinators. A new pesticide by the name of “Sivanto” was recently released by Bayer AG. Its active ingredient flupyradifurone binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AchR) in the honeybee brain, similar to neonicotinoids. Nevertheless, flupyradifurone is assumed to be harmless for honeybees and can even be applied on flowering crops. So far, only little has been known about sublethal effects of flupyradifurone on honeybees. Intact motor functions are decisive for numerous behaviors including foraging and dancing. We therefore selected a motor assay to investigate in how far sublethal doses of this pesticide affect behavior in young summer and long-lived winter honeybees. Our results demonstrate that flupyradifurone (830\,µmol/l) can evoke motor disabilities and disturb normal motor behavior after a single oral administration (1.2\,µg/bee). These effects are stronger in long-lived winter bees than in young summer bees. After offering an equal amount of pesticide (1.0–1.75\,µg) continuously over 24\,h with food the observed effects are slighter. For comparisons we repeated our experiments with the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Intriguingly, the alterations in behavior induced by this pesticide (4\,ng/bee) were different and longer-lasting compared to flupyradifurone, even though both substances bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the neurological effects of residual ground-water levels of thiacloprid~on the non-target organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Nematodes treated with thiacloprid showed a dose-dependent and significantly increased twitch response at concentrations above 50\,ng\,mL−1 that disabled their forward locomotion in liquid culture. In comparison with untreated controls, 10\,ng\,mL−1 thiacloprid perturbed the chemosensory ability of C. elegans such that the nematodes no longer demonstrated positive chemotaxis towards a NaCl chemo-attractant, reducing their chemotaxis index from +0.48 to near to zero. Nematodes also exhibited a locomotion characteristic of those devoid of chemo-attraction, making significantly more pirouetting turns of ≥90° than the untreated controls. Compared to the untreated controls, expression of the endocytosis-associated gene, Rab-10, was also increased in C. elegans that had developed to adulthood in the presence of 10\,ng\,mL−1 thiacloprid, suggesting their active engagement in increased recycling of affected cellular components, such as their nAChRs. Thus, even residual, low levels of this less potent neonicotinoid that may be found in field ground-water had measurable effects on a beneficial soil organism which may have environmental and ecological implications that are currently poorly understood.},

  abstract = {In Burkina Faso, as in most Sahelian countries, the failure to follow good agricultural practices coupled with poor soil and climate conditions in the locust control context lead to high environmental contaminations with pesticide residues. Thus, consumers being orally exposed to a combination of multiple pesticide residues through food and water intake, the digestive tract is a tissue susceptible to be directly exposed to these food contaminants. The aim of our work was to compare in vitro the impact of five desert locust control pesticides (Deltamethrin DTM, Fenitrothion FNT, Fipronil FPN, Lambda-cyalothrine LCT, and Teflubenzuron TBZ) alone and in combination on the human intestinal Caco-2 cells viability and function. Cells were exposed to 0.1–100 μM pesticides for 10 days alone or in mixture (MIX). Our results showed a cytotoxic effect of DTM, FNT, FPN, LCT, and TBZ alone or in combination in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. The most efficient were shown to be FPN and FNT impacting the cell layer integrity and/or barrier function, ALP activity, antioxidant enzyme activity, lipid peroxidation, Akt activation, and apoptosis. The presence of antioxidant reduced lipid peroxidation level and attenuated the pesticides-induced cell toxicity, suggesting that key mechanism of pesticides cytotoxicity may be linked to their pro-oxidative potential. A comparative analysis with the predicted cytotoxic effect of pesticides mixture using mathematical modeling shown that the combination of these pesticides led to synergistic effects rather than to a simple independent or dose addition effect.},

  abstract = {Background Organophosphate pesticides affect mammalian brain development through mechanisms separable from the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymatic activity and resultant cholinergic hyperstimulation. In the brain, AChE has two catalytically similar splice variants with distinct functions in development and repair. The rare, read-through isoform, AChE-R, is preferentially induced by injury and appears to promote repair and protect against neurodegeneration. Overexpression of the more abundant, synaptic isoform, AChE-S, enhances neurotoxicity. Objectives We exposed differentiating PC12 cells, a model for developing neurons, to 30 μM chlorpyrifos (CPF) or diazinon (DZN), or CPF oxon, the active metabolite that irreversibly inhibits AChE enzymatic activity, in order to determine whether they differentially induce the formation of AChE-S as a mechanistic predictor of developmental neurotoxicity. We then administered CPF or DZN to neonatal rats on postnatal days 1–4 using daily doses spanning the threshold for AChE inhibition (0–20\%); we then evaluated AChE gene expression in forebrain and brainstem on post-natal day 5. Results In PC12 cells, after 48 hr of exposure, CPF, CPF oxon, and DZN enhanced gene expression for AChE-R by about 20\%, whereas CPF and DZN, but not CPF oxon, increased AChE-S expression by 20–40\%. Thus, despite the fact that CPF oxon is a much more potent AChE inhibitor, it is the native compound (CPF) that induces expression of the neurotoxic AChE-S iso-form. For in vivo exposures, 1 mg/kg CPF had little or no effect, but 0.5 or 2 mg/kg DZN induced both AChE-R and AChE-S, with a greater effect in males. Conclusions Our results indicate that nonenzymatic functions of AChE variants may participate in and be predictive of the relative developmental neurotoxicity of organophosphates, and that the various organophosphates differ in the degree to which they activate this mechanism.},

Cypermethrin (CYP)2CYP cypermethrin.2, a pyrethroid pesticide is a potent neurotoxicant which induces adverse effects on non – target organisms, particularly fish. Present study was designed to evaluate in vivo effects of CYP on acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) activity, histopathology and ultra structure in brain of Catla catla. Fish was exposed to two sub-lethal concentrations of the pesticide (0.124 µg/L and 0.41 µg/L) for 45 days. Analysis of the brain tissue was done at an interval of 15, 30 and 45 days. Significant concentration and time dependent inhibition of AChE activity, and degree of tissue change (DTC3DTC degree of tissue change.3) with respect to control was observed in brain after the toxicant treatment. Light microscopy revealed several histoarchitectural lesions such as necrosis, oedema, vacuolization, spongiosis and gliosis. Transmission electron microscographs of the control fish depicted neurons surrounded by supporting neuroglial tissue. Mild to moderate cellular changes such as shrinkage of axoplasm, irregular nucleus and fragmented rough endoplasmic reticulum was observed after 15 days of exposure to the pesticide. Most severe cytological alterations noticed after prolonged exposure to the toxicant at higher concentration were degeneration and decompaction of myelin sheath, swollen, vacuolated mitochondria with fragmented cristae, and neuroglia featuring degenerated cells. Necrotic changes such as neuronal shrinkage, disintegration of plasma membrane and condensed chromatin, suggested apoptosis induction. The prevalence of partial or complete cristolysis in mitochondria indicates that oxidative phosphorylation was severely compromised. The observed biochemical \& cellular changes reflect the neurotoxic potential of cypermethrin at environmentally relevant sub-lethal concentration to Catla catla.},

These sources can be permanent, such as ponds, or incidental like dew or guttation droplets. The aim of the experiment was to investigate whether bees prefer guttation drops as a water source compared to dew or rain drops. Furthermore it was analysed if bees use these water sources up to a distance of 50m from their hives. Results: During the experiment 147 bees were observed scanning the surface of the plants without landing, 13 bees took up guttation fluid and 36 bees collected dew or rain drops. Few bees were observed collecting guttation fluid at 50m from their hives but most in close proximity of the hives. Furthermore, in some dead bees residues of the seed treatment were detected (imazalil: 0.0011 μg/bee – 0.329 μg/bee; LD50= 35.1 μg/bee). Conclusion: In the majority of observations, bees were spotted scanning the leaf area of the plants. Only single bees were observed that actually took up water from plant leaves. It seems these bees did not distinguish between dew, rain or guttation droplets. The majority of water collecting or bees resting on plants were observed in the close proximity of their hives.},

Instead, replaceability depended strongly on gene modules: genes in the same process tended to be similarly replaceable (e.g., sterol biosynthesis) or not (e.g., DNA replication initiation). Simulations confirmed selection for specific function can maintain replaceability despite extensive sequence divergence. Critical ancestral functions of many essential genes are thus retained in a pathway-specific manner, robust to drift in sequences, splicing, and protein interfaces.},

  abstract = {Pyrethroids are important insecticides used largely because of their high activity as an insecticide and their low mammalian toxicity. Some studies have demonstrated that these products, especially compounds with an α-cyano group, show neurotoxic effects on the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). In this study, we investigate with different methods the cell toxic effects of commercial, chemically different pyrethroid compounds on neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y. Natural pyrethrin and permethrin (both with no α-cyano group) and cypermethrin (with an α-cyano group), were studied. For toxicity determinations, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were exposed to pyrethroids at 0.1–100μM concentrations for 1 day. The cell toxicity was evaluated by determining the total ATP with a luminescence method, the mitochondrial metabolic activity (WST-test) with a photometric method, and the morphological changes of the cell cultures with microscopic digital photographing at different dose levels of compounds. The results obtained with WST-1 method and with the measurement of total ATP were different. ATP measurement seemed to show cytotoxicity at lower concentrations than WST-1 method. There was induction of enzyme activities with WST-1 test with all pyrethroid compounds studied at low concentrations. With the ATP assay, exposure to 0.1–100μM of natural pyrethrin, as well as of permethrin and cypermethrin showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity. The most toxic pyrethroid was cypermethrin followed by permethrin and natural pyrethrin. Our study confirms that the cell toxicity was dependent on the chemical structure of pyrethroids and pyrethroids without an α-cyano group show the weakest physiological effect. Microscopic photographs of exposed cell cultures correlated to the toxic effects revealed by the metabolic tests.},

The results showed that lipid peroxidation (LPO) in erythrocytes increased within 3 days of pyrethroid treatment. The increased oxidative stress resulted in an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). The increase in reduced glutathione (GSH) content in erythrocytes may probably be an initial adaptive response to increased oxidative stress in pyrethroid intoxicated rats. Erythrocytes and serum acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was measured in pyrethroid-induced oxidative stress as it may mimic inhibition in target tissues such as muscle and brain. The inhibition in erythrocytes and serum AChE activity was partially relieved over a period of time indicating recovery from pyrethroid intoxication. The increase in erythrocyte LPO correlated with the inhibition in erythrocyte AChE activity and so erythrocyte AChE can be a marker enzyme in pyrethroid toxicity. The results show oxidative stress and alteration in antioxidant enzymes in erythrocytes of pyrethroid intoxicated rats.},

  abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells possess the ability to simultaneously acquire resistance to an array of drugs with different cytotoxic activities. The genes involved in this acquisition are referred to as pleiotropic drug resistant (PDR) genes. Several semidominant, drug resistance-encoding PDR mutations have been found that map near the centromere on chromosome II, including PDR3-1 and PDR4-1. DNA sequencing of chromosome II identified a potential open reading frame, designated YBL03-23, that has the potential to encode a protein with strong sequence similarity to the product of the PDR1 gene, a zinc finger-containing transcription factor. Here we show that YBL03-23 is allelic with PDR3. The presence of a functional copy of either PDR1 or PDR3 is essential for drug resistance and expression of a putative membrane transporter-encoding gene, PDR5. Deletion mapping of the PDR5 promoter identified a region from -360 to -112 that is essential for expression of this gene. DNase I footprinting analysis using bacterially expressed Pdr3p showed specific recognition by this protein of at least one site in the -360/-112 interval in the PDR5 promoter. A high-copy-number plasmid carrying the PDR3 gene elevated resistance to both oligomycin and cycloheximide. Increasing the number of PDR3 gene copies in a delta pdr5 strain increased oligomycin resistance but was not able to correct the cycloheximide hypersensitivity that results from loss of PDR5. These data are consistent with the notion that PDR3 acts to increase cycloheximide resistance by elevating the level of PDR5 transcription, while PDR3-mediated oligomycin resistance acts through some other target gene.},

Mitochondria, as a primary site of cellular energy generation and oxygen consumption represent itself a likely target for organophosphate poisoning. Therefore, the objective of the current study was planned with an aim to investigate the effect of chronic dichlorvos exposure on mitochondrial calcium uptake, oxidative stress generation and its implication in the induction of neuronal apoptosis in rodent model. Mitochondrial preparation from dichlorvos (DDVP) treated rat brain demonstrated significant increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (644.2nmol/mg protein). Our results indicated decreased mitochondrial electron transfer activities of cytochrome oxidase (complex IV) along with altered mitochondrial complex I, and complex II activity, which might have resulted from elevated mitochondrial calcium uptake. The alterations in the mitochondrial calcium uptake and mitochondrial electron transfer enzyme activities in turn might have caused an increase in malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl and 8-hydoxydeoxyguanosine formation as a result of enhanced lipid peroxidation, and as well as protein and mtDNA oxidation. All this could have been because of enhanced oxidative stress, decreased GSH levels and also decreased Mn-SOD activity in the mitochondria isolated from dichlorvos treated rat brain. Thus, chronic organophosphate exposure has the potential to disrupt cellular antioxidant defense system which in turn triggers the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol as well as caspase-3 activation in dichlorvos treated rat brain as revealed by immunoblotting experiments. Low-level long-term organophosphate exposure finally resulted in oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis. These studies provide an evidence of impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and apoptotic neuronal degeneration after chronic low-level exposure to dichlorvos.},

Comparison of the rate of drug transport in natural versus artificial membranes shows discrepancies in absolute magnitudes of 100-fold or more, with the carrier-containing cells showing the greater permeability.

  abstract = {The emergence of agricultural land use change creates a number of challenges that insect pollinators, such as eusocial bees, must overcome. Resultant fragmentation and loss of suitable foraging habitats, combined with pesticide exposure, may increase demands on foraging, specifically the ability to collect or reach sufficient resources under such stress. Understanding effects that pesticides have on flight performance is therefore vital if we are to assess colony success in these changing landscapes. Neonicotinoids are one of the most widely used classes of pesticide across the globe, and exposure to bees has been associated with reduced foraging efficiency and homing ability. One explanation for these effects could be that elements of flight are being affected, but apart from a couple of studies on the honeybee (Apis mellifera), this has scarcely been tested. Here, we used flight mills to investigate how exposure to a field realistic (10 ppb) acute dose of imidacloprid affected flight performance of a wild insect pollinator—the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris audax. Intriguingly, observations showed exposed workers flew at a significantly higher velocity over the first ¾ km of flight. This apparent hyperactivity, however, may have a cost because exposed workers showed reduced flight distance and duration to around a third of what control workers were capable of achieving. Given that bumblebees are central place foragers, impairment to flight endurance could translate to a decline in potential forage area, decreasing the abundance, diversity, and nutritional quality of available food, while potentially diminishing pollination service capabilities.},

Chemical analysis of the waters revealed that they were polluted by sub-ppb or ppb level of organophosphate insecticides.

While the sweetest nectar offers the greatest energetic rewards, the sharp increase of viscosity with sugar concentration makes it the most difficult to transport. We here demonstrate that the sugar concentration that optimizes energy transport depends exclusively on the drinking technique employed. We identify three nectar drinking techniques: active suction, capillary suction, and viscous dipping. For each, we deduce the dependence of the volume intake rate on the nectar viscosity and thus infer an optimal sugar concentration consistent with laboratory measurements. Our results provide the first rationale for why suction feeders typically pollinate flowers with lower sugar concentration nectar than their counterparts that use viscous dipping.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acetamiprid (ACE) and imidacloprid (IMI) belong to a new, widely used class of pesticide, the neonicotinoids. With similar chemical structures to nicotine, neonicotinoids also share agonist activity at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Although their toxicities against insects are well established, their precise effects on mammalian nAChRs remain to be elucidated. Because of the importance of nAChRs for mammalian brain function, especially brain development, detailed investigation of the neonicotinoids is needed to protect the health of human children. We aimed to determine the effects of neonicotinoids on the nAChRs of developing mammalian neurons and compare their effects with nicotine, a neurotoxin of brain development. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Primary cultures of cerebellar neurons from neonatal rats allow for examinations of the developmental neurotoxicity of chemicals because the various stages of neurodevelopment-including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and morphological and functional maturation-can be observed in vitro. Using these cultures, an excitatory Ca(2+)-influx assay was employed as an indicator of neural physiological activity. Significant excitatory Ca(2+) influxes were evoked by ACE, IMI, and nicotine at concentrations greater than 1 µM in small neurons in cerebellar cultures that expressed the mRNA of the α3, α4, and α7 nAChR subunits. The firing patterns, proportion of excited neurons, and peak excitatory Ca(2+) influxes induced by ACE and IMI showed differences from those induced by nicotine. However, ACE and IMI had greater effects on mammalian neurons than those previously reported in binding assay studies. Furthermore, the effects of the neonicotinoids were significantly inhibited by the nAChR antagonists mecamylamine, α-bungarotoxin, and dihydro-β-erythroidine. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study is the first to show that ACE, IMI, and nicotine exert similar excitatory effects on mammalian nAChRs at concentrations greater than 1 µM. Therefore, the neonicotinoids may adversely affect human health, especially the developing brain.},

Populations of some bumble bee species are in decline, prompting the need to better understand bumble bee biology and to develop methodologies for assessing the effects of environmental stressors on these bees. Use of bumble bee microcolonies as an experimental tool is steadily increasing. This review closely examines the microcolony model using peer-reviewed published literature identified by searching three databases through November 2018. Microcolonies have been successfully used for investigating a range of endpoints including behavior, the gut microbiome, nutrition, development, pathogens, chemical biology, and pesticides/xenobiotics. Methods for the initiation and monitoring of microcolonies, as well as the recorded variables were catalogued and described. From this information, we identified a series of recommendations for standardizing core elements of microcolony studies. Standardization is critical to establishing the foundation needed to support use of this model for biological response investigations and particularly for supporting use in pesticide risk assessment.},

  abstract = {Those involved with pollinator risk assessment know that agricultural crops vary in attractiveness to bees. Intuitively, this means that exposure to agricultural pesticides is likely greatest for attractive plants and lowest for unattractive plants. While crop attractiveness in the risk assessment process has been qualitatively remarked on by some authorities, absent is direction on how to refine the process with quantitative metrics of attractiveness. At a high level, attractiveness of crops to bees appears to depend on several key variables, including but not limited to: floral, olfactory, visual and tactile cues; seasonal availability; physical and behavioral characteristics of the bee; plant and nectar rewards. Notwithstanding the complexities and interactions among these variables, sugar content in nectar stands out as a suitable quantitative metric by which to refine pollinator risk assessments for attractiveness. Provided herein is a proposed way to use sugar nectar concentration to adjust the exposure parameter (with what is called a crop attractiveness factor) in the calculation of risk quotients in order to derive crop‐specific tier I assessments. This Perspective is meant to invite discussion on incorporating such changes in the risk assessment process. © 2016 The Authors.

  abstract = {Apoptosis plays a major role in development, tissue renewal and the progression of degenerative diseases. Studies on various types of mammalian cells reported a pro-apoptotic function of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), particularly in the formation of the apoptosome and the degradation of nuclear DNA. While three AChE splice variants are present in mammals, invertebrates typically express two ache genes that code for a synaptically located protein and a protein with non-synaptic functions respectively. In order to investigate a potential contribution of AChE to apoptosis in insects, we selected the migratory locust Locusta migratoria. We established primary neuronal cultures of locust brains and characterized apoptosis progression in vitro. Dying neurons displayed typical characteristics of apoptosis, including caspase-activation, nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation visualized by TUNEL staining. Addition of the AChE inhibitors neostigmine and territrem B reduced apoptotic cell death under normal culture conditions. Moreover, both inhibitors completely suppressed hypoxia-induced neuronal cell death. Exposure of live animals to severe hypoxia moderately increased the expression of ace-1 in locust brains in vivo. Our results indicate a previously unreported role of AChE in insect apoptosis that parallels the pro-apoptotic role in mammalian cells. This similarity adds to the list of apoptotic mechanisms shared by mammals and insects, supporting the hypothesized existence of an ancient, complex apoptosis regulatory network present in common ancestors of vertebrates and insects.},

The potential genotoxic effects of thiacloprid on human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were investigated in vitro by the chromosome aberrations (CAs), sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), and cytokinesis-block micronucleus (MN) assays. The human PBLs were treated with 75, 150, and 300 μg/mL thiacloprid in the absence and presence of an exogenous metabolic activator (S9 mix). Thiacloprid increased the CAs and SCEs significantly at all concentrations (75, 150, and 300 μg/mL) both in the absence and presence of the S9 mix and induced a significant increase in MN and nucleoplasmic bridge formations at all concentrations for 24 h and at 75 and 150 μg/mL for 48-h treatment periods in the absence of the S9 mix; and at all concentrations in the presence of the S9 mix when compared with the control and solvent control. Thiacloprid was also found to significantly induce nuclear bud (NBUD) formation at 300 μg/mL for 24 h and at 150 μg/mL for 48-h treatment times in the absence of the S9 mix and at the two highest concentrations (150 and 300 μg/mL) in the presence of the S9 mix.

We demonstrate that when isolated mitochondria are exposed to calcium and NMDA agonists, there is a significant increase in mitochondrial calcium levels. The agonist/antagonist response studies on purified mitochondria suggest the presence of a receptor on mitochondria with features similar to plasma membrane NMDA receptors. Immunogold electron microscopy of hippocampal tissue sections revealed extensive localization of NR2a subunit immunoreactivity on mitochondria. Transient transfection of neuronal GT1-7 cells with an NR1-NR2a NMDA receptor subunit cassette specifically targeting mitochondria resulted in a significant increase in mitochondrial calcium and neuroprotection against glutamate-induced cell death. Mitochondria prepared from GT1-7 cells in which the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors was silenced demonstrated a decrease in calcium uptake. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that mitochondria express a calcium transport protein that shares characteristics with the NMDA receptor and may play a neuroprotective role.},

  abstract = {2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a persistent environmental pollutant that activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) resulting in altered gene expression. In vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo studies have demonstrated that B cells are directly impaired by TCDD, and are a sensitive target as evidenced by suppression of antibody responses. The window of sensitivity to TCDD-induced suppression of IgM secretion among mouse, rat and human B cells is similar. Specifically, TCDD must be present within the initial 12h post B cell stimulation, indicating that TCDD disrupts early signaling network(s) necessary for B lymphocyte activation and differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesized that TCDD treatment across three different species (mouse, rat and human) triggers a conserved, B cell-specific mechanism that is involved in TCDD-induced immunosuppression. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to identify B cell-specific orthologous genes that are differentially expressed in response to TCDD in primary mouse, rat and human B cells. Time course studies identified TCDD-elicited differential expression of 515 human, 2371 mouse and 712 rat orthologous genes over the 24-h period. 28 orthologs were differentially expressed in response to TCDD in all three species. Overrepresented pathways enriched in all three species included cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, regulation of actin cytoskeleton and pathways in cancer. Differentially expressed genes functionally associated with cell-cell signaling in humans, immune response in mice, and oxidation reduction in rats. Overall, these results suggest that despite the conservation of the AhR and its signaling mechanism, TCDD elicits species-specific gene expression changes.},

  abstract = {New discoveries in the last decade significantly altered our view on mitochondria. They are no longer viewed as energy-making slaves but rather individual cells-within-the-cell. In particular, it has been suggested that many important cellular mechanisms involving specific enzymes and ion channels, such as nitric oxide synthase (NOS), ATP-dependent K+ (KATP) channels, and poly-(APD-ribose) polymerase (PARP), have a distinct, mitochondrial variant. Unfortunately, exploring these parallel systems in mitochondria have technical limitations and inappropriate methods often led to inconsistent results. For example, the intriguing possibility that mitochondria are significant sources of nitric oxide (NO) via a unique mitochondrial NOS variant has attracted intense interest among research groups because of the potential for NO to affect functioning of the electron transport chain. Nonetheless, conclusive evidence concerning the existence of mitochondrial NO synthesis is yet to be presented. This review summarizes the experimental evidence gathered over the last decade in this field and highlights new areas of research that reveal surprising dimensions of NO production and metabolism by mitochondria.},

  abstract = {Despite over a billion years of evolutionary divergence, several thousand human genes possess clearly identifiable orthologs in yeast, and many have undergone lineage-specific duplications in one or both lineages. These duplicated genes may have been free to diverge in function since their expansion, and it is unclear how or at what rate ancestral functions are retained or partitioned among co-orthologs between species and within gene families. Thus, in order to investigate how ancestral functions are retained or lost post-duplication, we systematically replaced hundreds of essential yeast genes with their human orthologs from gene families that have undergone lineage-specific duplications, including those with single duplications (1 yeast gene to 2 human genes, 1:2) or higher-order expansions (1:{$>$}2) in the human lineage. We observe a variable pattern of replaceability across different ortholog classes, with an obvious trend toward differential replaceability inside gene families, and rarely observe replaceability by all members of a family. We quantify the ability of various properties of the orthologs to predict replaceability, showing that in the case of 1:2 orthologs, replaceability is predicted largely by the divergence and tissue-specific expression of the human co-orthologs, i.e., the human proteins that are less diverged from their yeast counterpart and more ubiquitously expressed across human tissues more often replace their single yeast ortholog. These trends were consistent with in silico simulations demonstrating that when only one ortholog can replace its corresponding yeast equivalent, it tends to be the least diverged of the pair. Replaceability of yeast genes having more than 2 human co-orthologs was marked by retention of orthologous interactions in functional or protein networks as well as by more ancestral subcellular localization. Overall, we performed {$>$}400 human gene replaceability assays, revealing 50 new human–yeast complementation pairs, thus opening up avenues to further functionally characterize these human genes in a simplified organismal context.},

To determine whether environmentally realistic levels of imidacloprid are capable of making a demographic impact on bumble bees, we exposed queenless microcolonies of worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, to a range of dosages of dietary imidacloprid between zero and 125~μg~L−1 and examined the effects on ovary development and fecundity.

Imidacloprid reduced feeding on both syrup and pollen but, after controlling statistically for dosage, microcolonies that consumed more syrup and pollen produced more brood.

  abstract = {Currently, there is concern about declining bee populations and some blame the residues of neonicotinoid pesticides in the nectar and pollen of treated crops. Bumble bees are important wild pollinators that are widely exposed to dietary neonicotinoids by foraging in agricultural environments. In the laboratory, we tested the effect of a pulsed exposure (14 days ‘on dose’ followed by 14 days ‘off dose’) to a common neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, on the amount of brood (number of eggs and larvae) produced by Bombus terrestris L. bumble bees in small, standardised experimental colonies (a queen and four adult workers). During the initial ‘on dose’ period we observed a dose-dependent repression of brood production in colonies, with productivity decreasing as dosage increased up to 98 µg kg−1 dietary imidacloprid. During the following ‘off dose’ period, colonies showed a dose-dependent recuperation such that total brood production during the 28-day pulsed exposure was not correlated with imidacloprid up to 98 µg kg−1. Our findings raise further concern about the threat to wild bumble bees from neonicotinoids, but they also indicate some resilience to a pulsed exposure, such as that arising from the transient bloom of a treated mass-flowering crop.},

  abstract = {Neonicotinoid pesticides are currently implicated in the decline of wild bee populations. Bumble bees, Bombus spp., are important wild pollinators that are detrimentally affected by ingestion of neonicotinoid residues. To date, imidacloprid has been the major focus of study into the effects of neonicotinoids on bumble bee health, but wild populations are increasingly exposed to alternative neonicotinoids such as thiamethoxam. To investigate whether environmentally realistic levels of thiamethoxam affect bumble bee performance over a realistic exposure period, we exposed queenless microcolonies of Bombus terrestris L. workers to a wide range of dosages up to 98μgkg−1 in dietary syrup for 17 days. Results showed that bumble bee workers survived fewer days when presented with syrup dosed at 98μg thiamethoxamkg−1, while production of brood (eggs and larvae) and consumption of syrup and pollen in microcolonies were significantly reduced by thiamethoxam only at the two highest concentrations (39, 98μgkg−1). In contrast, we found no detectable effect of thiamethoxam at levels typically found in the nectars of treated crops (between 1 and 11μgkg−1). By comparison with published data, we demonstrate that during an exposure to field-realistic concentrations lasting approximately two weeks, brood production in worker bumble bees is more sensitive to imidacloprid than thiamethoxam. We speculate that differential sensitivity arises because imidacloprid produces a stronger repression of feeding in bumble bees than thiamethoxam, which imposes a greater nutrient limitation on production of brood.},

When done appropriately, independent replication of the entity–intervention pair contributes to the sample size (N) and forms the basis of statistical inference. If the wrong entity–intervention pair is chosen, an experiment cannot address the question of interest. We surveyed a random sample of published animal experiments from 2011 to 2016 where interventions were applied to parents and effects examined in the offspring, as regulatory authorities provide clear guidelines on replication with such designs. We found that only 22\% of studies (95\% CI = 17\%–29\%) replicated the correct entity–intervention pair and thus made valid statistical inferences. Nearly half of the studies (46\%, 95\% CI = 38\%–53\%) had pseudoreplication while 32\% (95\% CI = 26\%–39\%) provided insufficient information to make a judgement. Pseudoreplication artificially inflates the sample size, and thus the evidence for a scientific claim, resulting in false positives. We argue that distinguishing between biological units, experimental units, and observational units clarifies where replication should occur, describe the criteria for genuine replication, and provide concrete examples of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experimental designs.},

  abstract = {Declines in honey bee populations represent a worldwide concern. The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides has been one of the factors linked to these declines. Sublethal doses of a neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, has been reported to cause olfactory learning deficits in honey bees via impairment of the target organ, the brain. In the present study, olfactory learning of honey bees was compared between controls and imidacloprid-treated bees. The brains of imidacloprid-treated and control bees were used for comparative transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq to elucidate the effects of imidacloprid on honey bee learning capacity. The results showed that the learning performance of imidacloprid-treated bees was significantly impaired in comparison with control bees after chronic oral exposure to imidacloprid (0.02 ng/μl) for 11 days. Gene expression profiles between imidacloprid treatment and the control revealed that 131 genes were differentially expressed, of which 130 were downregulated in imidacloprid-treated bees. Validation of the RNA-Seq data using qRT-PCR showed that the results of qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq exhibited a high level of agreement. Gene ontology annotation indicated that the oxidation-reduction imbalance might exist in the brain of honey bees due to oxidative stress induced by imidacloprid exposure. KEGG and ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that transient receptor potential and Arrestin 2 in the phototransduction pathway were significantly downregulated in imidacloprid-treated bees, and that five downregulated genes have causal effects on behavioral response inhibition in imidacloprid-treated bees. Our results suggest that downregulation of brain genes involved in immune, detoxification and chemosensory responses may result in decreased olfactory learning capabilities in imidacloprid-treated bees.},

The cell wall structure is dynamic and can adapt to different physiological states or environmental conditions. For the investigation of morphological changes, selective staining with fluorescent dyes is a valuable tool. Furthermore, cell wall staining is used to facilitate sub-cellular localization experiments with fluorescently-labeled proteins and the detection of yeast cells in non-fungal host tissues. Here, we report staining of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall with Trypan Blue, which emits strong red fluorescence upon binding to chitin and yeast glucan; thereby, it facilitates cell wall analysis by confocal and super-resolution microscopy. The staining pattern of Trypan Blue was similar to that of the widely used UV-excitable, blue fluorescent cell wall stain Calcofluor White. Trypan Blue staining facilitated quantification of cell size and cell wall volume when utilizing the optical sectioning capacity of a confocal microscope. This enabled the quantification of morphological changes during growth under anaerobic conditions and in the presence of chemicals, demonstrating the potential of this approach for morphological investigations or screening assays.},

Therefore, the effects of soil microbial activity on the degradation and bioefficacy persistence of the four neonicotinoids were evaluated. RESULTS: In unsterilised soils, 94.0\% of acetamiprid and 98.8\% of thiacloprid were degraded within 15 days, while only 22.5\% of imidacloprid and 25.1\% of imidaclothiz were degraded over a longer period of 25 days. In contrast, in sterilised soils, the degradation rates of acetamiprid and thiacloprid were respectively only 21.4\% and 27.6\%, whereas the degradation rates of imidaclothiz and imidacloprid were respectively 9.0\% and almost 0\% within 25 days. The degradation products of imidacloprid and imidaclothiz were identified as olefin, nitroso or guanidine metabolites, the degradation product of thiacloprid was identified as an amide metabolite and no degradation product of acetamiprid was detected. A bioefficacy assay revealed that the bioefficacy and persistence of imidacloprid, imidaclothiz, acetamiprid and thiacloprid against horsebean aphid A. craccivora were related to their degradation rate and the bioefficacy of their degradation products in soil. CONCLUSION: Soil microbial activity played a key role in the bioefficacy persistence of neonicotinoid insecticides and therefore significantly affected their technical profile after soil application.},

We found that L. passim decreases mRNAs associated with protein translation, glycolysis, detoxification of radical oxygen species, and kinetoplast respiratory chain to adapt to the anaerobic and nutritionally poor honey bee hindgut during the infection. After the long term infection, the host appears to be in poor nutritional status, indicated by the increase and decrease of take-out and vitellogenin mRNAs, respectively. Simultaneous gene expression profiling of L. passim and honey bee during infection by dual RNA-seq provided insight into how both parasite and host modify their gene expressions.},

Such molecules also can cross cellular membranes by passive diffusion unaided by transport proteins. No metabolic energy is expended because movement is from a high to a low concentration of the molecule, down its chemical concentration gradient. As noted in Chapter 2, such transport reactions have a positive ΔS value (increase in entropy) and a negative ΔG (decrease in free energy). The relative diffusion rate of a substance across the bilayer is proportional to its concentration gradient across the layer and to its hydrophobicity. There is little specificity to the process, in that any small hydrophobic molecule will be transported.Figure 15-1A pure artificial phospholipid bilayer is permeable to small hydrophobic molecules and small uncharged polar moleculesIt is slightly permeable to water and urea and impermeable to ions and to large uncharged polar molecules.

The ecological significance of these compounds remains unclear, and their impact on bees is largely unexplored. Here, we studied the impact of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) found in the pollen of Echium vulgare on honeybee adults and larvae. Echimidine, a PA present in E. vulgare pollen, was isolated and added to the honeybee diets in order to perform toxicity bioassays. While adult bees showed relatively high tolerance to PAs, larvae were much more sensitive. In contrast to other bees, the honeybee larval diet typically contains only traces of pollen and consists predominantly of hypopharyngeal and mandibular secretions produced by nurse bees, which feed on large quantities of pollen-containing bee bread. We quantified the transfer of PAs to nursing secretions produced by bees that had previously consumed bee bread supplemented with PAs. The PA concentration in these secretions was reduced by three orders of magnitude as compared to the PA content in the nurse diet and was well below the toxicity threshold for larvae. Our results suggest that larval nursing protects honeybee larvae from the toxic effect of secondary metabolites of pollen.},

The information has been obtained by searching the relevant literature using chemical abstracts, PubMed, scopus, medline and other data bases. The significance of the problem has been elucidated. Organophosphate insecticides (OP), apart from inhibition of cholinesterase and presence of cholinergic effects, oxidative stress and hyperglycemia has been reported by many authors as one of the adverse effects in poisoning by OP in both humans and animals. Oxidative stress induced by organophosphate leads to disturbances in the function of different organs and tissues. In subchronic or chronic OP exposition induction of oxidative stress has been reported, by many authors, as the main mechanism of its toxicity. Data were categorized according to animal studies (in vitro and in vivo) and clinical studies. On the basis of relevant literature it is concluded, that determination of oxidative stress parameters can be useful for monitoring people exposed to OP professionally. Supplementation with natural or synthetic antioxidant may be beneficial in OP poisoning, however the rat models of OP poisoning used in those studies do not completely reflect clinical situation. For this reason the clinical trials are needed to explore effectiveness of these antioxidants in protection against toxicity of OP.},

The expression of acetylcholinesterase and other cholinergic components is not restricted to only brain and nerve tissues but can also be found in non-neuronal tissues like the immune system and bone tissue. Primary identification of these components has been achieved. However, the information about their specific functions and underlying molecular mechanisms in bone remains scattered. Here, the physiological process of bone development, homeostasis, and degeneration are introduced. Next, the cholinergic system and its expression in bone tissue is documented. Among them, special attention goes to AChE, as the structure of this enzyme suggests diverse binding affinities, enabled by a peripheral site and a catalytic site. The peripheral site supports the non-enzymatic function of AChE in non-neuronal systems. Based on recent studies, the non-neuronal roles of acetylcholinesterase, both enzymatically and non-enzymatically, in bone development, homeostasis and degeneration are summarized briefly together with potential mechanisms to support these functions. We conclude that AChE may be a potential therapeutic target for bone diseases like osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {The transcription factors Pdr1p and Pdr3p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mediate pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) by controlling expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as Pdr5p, Snq2p and Yor1p. Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that Pdr1p and Pdr3p recognize so-called pleiotropic drug resistance elements (PDREs) in the promoters of target genes. In this study, we show that both Pdr1p and Pdr3p are phosphoproteins; Pdr3p isoforms migrate as two bands in gel electrophoresis, reflecting two distinct phosphorylation states. Most importantly, native co-immunoprecipitation experiments, using functional epitope-tagged Pdr1p/Pdr3p variants, demonstrate that Pdr1p and Pdr3p can form both homo- and heterodimers in vivo. Furthermore, in vivo footprinting of PDRE-containing promoters demonstrate that Pdr1p/Pdr3p constitutively occupy both perfect and degenerate PDREs in vivo. Thus, in addition to interaction with other regulators, differential dimerization provides a plausible explanation for the observation that Pdr3p and Pdr1p can both positively and negatively control PDR promoters with different combinations of perfect and degenerate PDREs.},

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that cholinergic input to the hippocampus plays an important role in learning and memory and that degeneration of cholinergic terminals in the hippocampus may contribute to the memory loss associated with Alzheimer’s disease. One of the more prominent effects of cholinergic agonists on hippocampal physiology is the potentiation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor currents by muscarinic agonists. Here, we employ traditional pharmacological reagents as well as m1-toxin, an m1 antagonist with unprecedented selectivity, to demonstrate that this potentiation of NMDA-receptor currents in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells is mediated by the genetically defined m1 muscarinic receptor. Furthermore, we demonstrate the colocalization of the m1 muscarinic receptor and the NR1a NMDA receptor subunit at the electron microscopic level, indicating a spatial relationship that would allow for physiological interactions between these two receptors. This work demonstrates that the m1-muscarinic receptor gene product modulates excitatory synaptic transmission, and it has important implications in the study of learning and memory as well as the design of drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s.},

  abstract = {Declining insect population sizes are provoking grave concern around the world as insects play essential roles in food production and ecosystems. Environmental contamination by intense insecticide usage is consistently proposed as a significant contributor, among other threats. Many studies have demonstrated impacts of low doses of insecticides on insect behavior, but have not elucidated links to insecticidal activity at the molecular and cellular levels. Here, the histological, physiological, and behavioral impacts of imidacloprid are investigated in Drosophila melanogaster, an experimental organism exposed to insecticides in the field. We show that oxidative stress is a key factor in the mode of action of this insecticide at low doses. Imidacloprid produces an enduring flux of Ca2+ into neurons and a rapid increase in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the larval brain. It affects mitochondrial function, energy levels, the lipid environment, and transcriptomic profiles. Use of RNAi to induce ROS production in the brain recapitulates insecticide-induced phenotypes in the metabolic tissues, indicating that a signal from neurons is responsible. Chronic low level exposures in adults lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, severe damage to glial cells, and impaired vision. The potent antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA), reduces the severity of a number of the imidacloprid-induced phenotypes, indicating a causal role for oxidative stress. Given that other insecticides are known to generate oxidative stress, this research has wider implications. The systemic impairment of several key biological functions, including vision, reported here would reduce the resilience of insects facing other environmental challenges.},

After selective sample extraction, pesticides were identified and quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). The contamination profile in water and sediments is marked by the presence of organophosphorus and triazines. Transformation products were even at higher concentrations than parent pesticides. A wider range of pesticides was present in water than in sediments but none of them were detected in fish. The mean concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 13.0ng/L in water and from 0.1 to 13.2ng/g d.w. in sediment. The spatial distribution of most pesticides was consistent with the agricultural activities of the area or their urban applications. The waste water treatment plant effluents that impact the river are minor sources for few pesticides but for most of them run-off would be the most important contribution. The temporal distribution showed differences between both sampling campaigns related to the river flow. The low-flow produced a pesticide concentration effect, generating higher levels in water and accumulation in sediments. This forecasts a hazard in future scenarios if the current situation of the climate change and water scarcity evolves to more critical conditions highlighting the need of these monitoring studies.},

Water molecules, and those of hydrophobic substances such as hydrocarbons, can take part in and/or modify these interactions and thereby determine the operational and structural stability of the microbial cell and its macromolecular systems. We explain how the cytosol, plasma membrane and the extracellular solution form a material and energetic continuum; and discuss the behavior of hydrophobic substances of extracellular origin as they migrate into the plasma membrane and into the cell’s interior. The adverse effects of substances with a log Poctanol-water !2, that partition into the hydrophobic domains of biological macromolecules, are discussed in relation to microbial cell function; and we speculate whether the cellular stress that they induce is symmetrical or asymmetrical in nature. In the context of the microbial environment, we take a situational-functional approach to consider how hydrophobic stressors interact with the microbial cell, and what types of evasion tactics microbes can employ to minimize their inhibitory activities. Finally, we discuss the ecological implications of hydrocarbon-induced cellular stress for microbial systems.},

  abstract = {There is an on-going need to develop new insecticides that are not compromised by resistance and that have improved environmental profiles. However, the cost of developing novel compounds has increased significantly over the last two decades. This is in part due to increased regulatory requirements, including the need to screen both pest and pollinator insect species to ensure that pre-existing resistance will not hamper the efficacy of a new insecticide via cross-resistance, or adversely affect non-target insect species. To add to this problem the collection and maintenance of toxicologically relevant pest and pollinator species and strains is costly and often difficult. Here we present Fly-Tox, a panel of publicly available transgenic Drosophila melanogaster lines each containing one or more pest or pollinator P450 genes that have been previously shown to metabolise insecticides. We describe the range of ways these tools can be used, including in predictive screens to avoid pre-existing cross-resistance, to identify potential resistance-breaking inhibitors, in the initial assessment of potential insecticide toxicity to bee pollinators, and identifying harmful pesticide-pesticide interactions.},

Because calcium homeostasis is essential for proper neuronal function and development, we investigated the effects of insecticides from different classes (pyrethroid: (α-)cypermethrin; organophosphate: chlorpyrifos; organochlorine: endosulfan; neonicotinoid: imidacloprid) and mixtures thereof on the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). Effects of acute (20~min) exposure to (mixtures of) insecticides on basal and depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i were studied in vitro with Fura-2-loaded PC12 cells and high resolution single-cell fluorescence microscopy. The data demonstrate that cypermethrin, α-cypermethrin, endosulfan, and chlorpyrifos concentration-dependently decreased depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i, with 50\% (IC50) at 78nM, 239nM, 250nM, and 899nM, respectively. Additionally, acute exposure to chlorpyrifos or endosulfan (10μM) induced a modest increase in basal [Ca2+]i, amounting to 68 ± 8nM and 53 ± 8nM, respectively. Imidacloprid did not disturb basal or depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i at 10μM. Following exposure to binary mixtures, effects on depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i were within the expected effect additivity range, whereas the effect of the tertiary mixture was less than this expected additivity effect range. These results demonstrate that different types of insecticides inhibit depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i in PC12 cells by inhibiting voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in vitro at concentrations comparable with human occupational exposure levels. Moreover, the effective concentrations in this study are below those for earlier described modes of action. Because inhibition of VGCCs appears to be a common and potentially additive mode of action of several classes of insecticides, this target should be considered in neurotoxicity risk assessment studies.},

OPs can induce additional neurotoxic effects at concentrations below those for inhibition of AChE, indicating other mechanisms of action are also involved. Since tight regulation of the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) is essential for proper neuronal development and function, effects of one carbamate (carbaryl) and two OPs (chlorpyrifos, parathion-ethyl) as well as their -oxon metabolites on [Ca2+]i were investigated. Effects of acute (20min) exposure to (mixtures of) insecticides on basal and depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i were measured in fura-2-loaded PC12 cells using single-cell fluorescence microscopy. Acute exposure to chlorpyrifos and its metabolite chlorpyrifos-oxon (10μM) induced a modest increase in basal [Ca2+]i. More importantly, the tested OPs concentration-dependently inhibited depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i. Chlorpyrifos already induced a ∼30\% inhibition at 0.1μM and a 100\% inhibition at 10μM (IC50=0.43μM), whereas parathion-ethyl inhibited the depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i increase with ∼70\% at 10μM. Interestingly, -oxon metabolites were more potent inhibitors of AChE, but were less potent inhibitors of depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i compared to their parent compound (chlorpyrifos-oxon) or were even without effect (paraoxon-ethyl and -methyl). Similarly, acute exposure to carbaryl had no effect on [Ca2+]i. Exposure to mixtures of chlorpyrifos with its oxon-analog or with parathion-ethyl did not increase the degree of inhibition, indicating additivity does not apply. These data demonstrate that concentration-dependent inhibition of depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i is a novel mechanism of action of (sub)micromolar concentrations of OPs that could partly underlie OP-induced neurotoxicity.},

  abstract = {Commercial formulations of pesticides are invariably not single ingredients. Instead they are cocktails of chemicals, composed of a designated pesticidal “active principle” and “other ingredients”, with the latter collectively also known as “adjuvants”. These include surfactants, anti-foaming agents, dyes, etc. Some adjuvants are added to influence the absorption and stability of the active principle, and thus promote its pesticidal action. At present the health risk assessment of pesticides in the European Union and in the United States focuses almost exclusively on the stated active principle. Nonetheless, adjuvants can also be toxic in their own right with numerous negative health effects having been reported in humans and on the environment. Despite the known toxicity of adjuvants they are regulated differently from active principles, with their toxic effects being generally ignored. Adjuvants are not subject to an acceptable daily intake and they are not included in the health risk assessment of dietary exposures to pesticide residues. Here we illustrate this gap in risk assessment by reference to glyphosate, the most used pesticide active ingredient. We also investigate the case of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are strongly suspected to be involved in bee and bumblebee colony collapse disorder. Authors of studies sometimes use the name of the active principle (for example glyphosate) when they are testing a commercial formulation containing multiple (active principle plus adjuvant) ingredients. This results in confusion in the scientific literature and within regulatory circles, and leads to a misrepresentation of the safety profile of commercial pesticides. Urgent action is needed to lift the veil on the presence of adjuvants in food and human bodily fluids, as well as in the environment (such as in air, water and soil), and to characterize their toxicological properties. This must be accompanied by regulatory precautionary measures to protect the environment and general human population from some toxic adjuvants that are currently missing from risk assessments.},

In the eusocial Hymenoptera, inclusive fitness depends on successful mating of male sexuals (drones) and efficient collaborative brood care by female workers. Therefore, sublethal insecticide effects on sperm and glands used in larval feeding (hypopharyngeal glands (HPG)) would provide key mechanisms for population declines in eusocial insects. However, while negative impacts for bumblebee colony fitness have been documented, the effects of insecticide exposure on individual physiology are less well understood. Here, we show that field-realistic concentrations (4.5–40 ng ml−1) of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam significantly impair Bombus terrestris sperm and HPGs, thereby providing plausible mechanisms underlying bumblebee population decline. In the laboratory, drones and workers were exposed to five thiamethoxam concentrations (4.5 to 1000 ng ml−1). Then, survival, food consumption, body mass, HPG development, sperm quantity and viability were assessed. At all concentrations, drones were more exposed than workers due to higher food consumption. Increased body mass was observed in drones starting at 20 ng ml−1 and in workers at 100 ng ml−1. Furthermore, environmentally realistic concentrations (4.5–40 ng ml−1) did not significantly affect survival or consumption for either sex. However, thiamethoxam exposure significantly negatively affected both sperm viability and HPG development at all tested concentrations. Therefore, the results indicate a trade-off between survival and fitness components, possibly due to costly detoxification. Since sperm and HPG are corner stones of colony fitness, the data offer plausible mechanisms for bumblebee population declines. To adequately mitigate ongoing biodiversity declines for the eusocial insects, this study suggests it is essential to evaluate the impact of insecticides on fitness parameters of both sexuals and workers.},

Yet X-77 and 6 other surfactants (Brij® 30, Brij® 92, dimethyl sulfoxide, Span® 20, Tween® 20, and XF-1-3655 (nonionic water soluble silicone-glycol copolymer)) were relatively nontoxic to the bees as stomach poisons. Drowning occurred when the X-77 water was supplied in plastic buckets, dirt ponds, and cement ditches. The bees preferred water without X-77 to water containing X-77 by more than a 10 to 1 margin when given a free choice on drip boards or in cement ponds. X-77 retained sufficient activity to drown bees in cement ponds for more than 60 days after it was added at 500 ppmv to the water.During hot weather in June, July, and August, 1971, caged colonies with X-77 added to their water supply quickly ceased rearing brood, and all unsealed larvae died and some of the colonies died. Yet colonies receiving the same treatment during cooler weather did not suffer any observable damage although there was a continuous and heavy loss of water carriers.Surfactants in small ponds, puddles, or irrigation ditches could cause bee losses. Given free choice, bees preferred water without X-77, but collected large quantities of water containing surfactant when confined to cages or when in apiaries with no other water source available.},

  abstract = {Malathion is an organophosphate pesticide that is known for its high toxicity to insects and low to moderate potency to humans and other mammals. Its toxicity has been associated with the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity, leading to the interference with the transmission of nerve impulse, accumulation of acetylcholine at synaptic junctions, and subsequent induction of adverse health effects including headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, and miosis. Oxidative stress (OS) has been reported as a possible mechanism of malathion toxicity in humans. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine the role of OS in malathion-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. To achieve this goal, MTT, lipid peroxidation, and single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assays were performed, respectively, to evaluate the levels of cell viability, malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and DNA damage in human liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Study results indicated that malathion is mitogenic at lower levels of exposure, and cytotoxic at higher levels of exposure. Upon 48 h of exposure, the average percentages of cell viability were 100\% ± 11\%, 117\% ± 15\%, 86\% ± 15\%, 35\% ± 9\%, and 27\% ± 7\% for 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mM, respectively. In the lipid peroxidation assay, the concentrations of MDA produced were 12.55 ± 0.16, 20.65 ± 0.27, 31.1 ± 0.40, 34.75 ± 0.45, and 15.1 ± 0.20 μM in 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mM malathion, respectively. The Comet assay showed a significant increase in DNA damage at the 24 mM malathion exposure. Taken together, our results indicate that malathion exposure at higher concentrations induces cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in HepG2 cells, and its toxicity may be mediated through OS as evidenced by a significant production of MDA, an end product of lipid peroxidation. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It is unclear how the developing brains of honey bee larvae are affected by sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides when measuring neural processes through behavioural performance in adult bees. In this study, larvae were exposed to three sublethal doses of clothianidin and evaluated 25–36 days later for hygienic and foraging behaviours as adult bees. The medium and highest sublethal doses of clothianidin significantly reduced hygienic and foraging activity. The greatest effects were on the proportion of adult bees foraging and carrying pollen. These results show that exposure of larvae to clothianidin results in negative effects extending into the adulthood of bees, possibly compromising the colony’s fitness by impairing pathogen control mechanisms and by reducing pollen collection.},

Larvae were exposed singly and in combination to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and three sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin to evaluate their effects on survivorship, weight, haemocyte counts, deformed wing virus (DWV) levels and gene expression of the adult bees that subsequently developed. Clothianidin significantly reduced bee weight at the highest dose and was associated with an increase in haemocyte counts at the lowest dose, whereas V. destructor parasitism increased DWV levels, reduced bee emergence, lowered weight and reduced haemocyte counts. An interaction between the two stressors was observed for weight at emergence. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), V. destructor infestation resulted in broader down-regulatory effects related to immunity that was often shared with the combined stressors, while clothianidin resulted in a broader up-regulatory effect more related to central metabolic pathways that was often shared with the combined stressors. Parasites and abiotic stressors can have complex interactions, including additive effects on reduced weight, number of up-regulated DEGs and biological pathways associated with metabolism.},

Male rats were divided into 4 groups: (i) received only olive oil (ii) treated with 64.0 mg/kg body weight prallethrin (1/10 LD50) in olive oil via oral route daily for 28 days, (iii) treated with 64.0 mg/kg body weight prallethrin (1/10 LD50) and EO (160\,μL/kg\,b.wt.) in olive oil and (iv) received EO (160\,μL/kg\,b.wt.) in olive oil via oral route twice daily for 28 days. Prallethrin treatment caused decrease in body weight gain and increase in relative liver weight. There was a significant increase in the activity of serum marker enzymes, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase. It caused increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and reduction in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione-S-transferase in liver. Consistent histological changes were found in the liver of prallethrin treatment. EO showed significant protection with the depletion of serum marker enzymes and replenishment of antioxidant status and brought all the values to near normal, indicating the protective effect of EO. We can conclude that prallethrin caused oxidative damage and liver injury in male rat and co-administration of EO attenuated the toxic effect of prallethrin. These results demonstrate that administration of EO may be useful, easy, and economical to protect human against pyrethroids toxic effects.},

This process is less understood than pesticide extraction with organic solvents. To elucidate the dissipation behavior of water-extractable pesticides in soils, we conducted an incubation study using 27 pesticides and five Japanese soils. The rate of decrease of the level of pesticides in water extracts was faster in soils than that of total extracts (water extracts and acetone extracts). This suggests that time-dependent sorption contributed to the difference in the dissipation between the pesticides in water and total extracts from soils. Increased apparent sorption coefficients (Kd,app) with time were positively and significantly correlated with Kd,app values of a 0 day incubation [Kd,app(t0)]. This empirical relationship suggests that Kd,app(t0) values can predict the time-dependent increase in Kd,app and the dissipation of water-extractable pesticides in soils.},

  abstract = {Honey bees are important agricultural pollinators that rely on a specific gut microbiota for the regulation of their immune system and defense against pathogens. Environmental stressors that affect the bee gut microbial community, such as antibiotics and glyphosate, can indirectly compromise bee health. Most of the experiments demonstrating these effects have been done under laboratory conditions with pure chemicals. Here, we investigated the oral and topical effects of various concentrations of glyphosate in a herbicide formulation on the honey bee gut microbiota and health under laboratory and field conditions. Under all of these conditions, the formulation, dissolved in sucrose syrup or water, affected the abundance of beneficial bacteria in the bee gut in a dose-dependent way. Mark-recapture experiments also demonstrated that bees exposed to the formulation were more likely to disappear from the colony, once reintroduced after exposure. Although no visible effects were observed for hives exposed to the formulation in field experiments, challenge trials with the pathogen Serratia marcescens, performed under laboratory conditions, revealed that bees from hives exposed to the formulation exhibited increased mortality compared with bees from control hives. In the field experiments, glyphosate was detected in honey collected from exposed hives, showing that worker bees transfer xenobiotics to the hive, thereby extending exposure and increasing the chances of exposure to recently emerged bees. These findings show that different routes of exposure to glyphosate-based herbicide can affect honey bees and their gut microbiota. IMPORTANCE The honey bee gut microbial community plays a vital role in immune response and defense against opportunistic pathogens. Environmental stressors, such as the herbicide glyphosate, may affect the gut microbiota, with negative consequences for bee health. Glyphosate is usually sprayed in the field mixed with adjuvants, which enhance herbicidal activity. These adjuvants may also enhance undesired effects in nontargeted organisms. This seems to be the case for glyphosate-based herbicide on honey bees. As we show in this study, oral exposure to either pure glyphosate or glyphosate in a commercial herbicide formulation perturbs the gut microbiota of honey bees, and topical exposure to the formulation also has a direct effect on honey bee health, increasing mortality in a dose-dependent way and leaving surviving bees with a perturbed microbiota. Understanding the effects of herbicide formulations on honey bees may help to protect these important agricultural pollinators.},

Larval mortality was observed at the higher dosed groups (0.2, 0.5, and 50.0 ppm). Following pair mating of virgin flies emerging from the treatment groups, a significant (p {$<$} 0.05) effect on reproduction was observed in the lowest two dietary concentrations of the test chemical as compared to control. The test chemical exhibited a hazardous effect on the reproductive organs of the exposed organism as evident by Hsp70 expression and tissue damage. The impact of damage was comparatively more prominent in male flies than in females. Hsp70 expression was restricted only within the testis lobes of male, while ovary in the female fly did not exhibit any Hsp70 expression. Interestingly, the accessory glands of male flies in these treatment groups reflected intense tissue damage as evident by Trypan Blue staining. This was further corroborated by ultrastructural changes like higher vacuolization and disorganized filamentous bodies in the accessory glands of these groups. The present study indicates a profound effect on reproduction by cypermethrin and suggests the protective role of hsp70.},

  abstract = {Dr. Fumio Matsumura's legacy embraced a passion for exploring environmental impacts of agrochemicals on non-target species such as bees. Why most formulations are more toxic to bees than respective active ingredients and how pesticides interact to cause pollinator decline cannot be answered without understanding the prevailing environmental chemical background to which bees are exposed. Modern pesticide formulations and seed treatments, particularly when multiple active ingredients are blended, require proprietary adjuvants and inert ingredients to achieve high efficacy for targeted pests. Although we have found over 130 different pesticides and metabolites in beehive samples, no individual pesticide or amount correlates with recent bee declines. Recently we have shown that honey bees are sensitive to organosilicone surfactants, nonylphenol polyethoxylates and the solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), widespread co-formulants used in agrochemicals and frequent pollutants within the beehive. Effects include learning impairment for adult bees and chronic toxicity in larval feeding bioassays. Multi-billion pounds of formulation ingredients like NMP are used and released into US environments. These synthetic organic chemicals are generally recognized as safe, have no mandated tolerances, and residues remain largely unmonitored. In contrast to finding about 70\% of the pesticide active ingredients searched for in our pesticide analysis of beehive samples, we have found 100\% of the other formulation ingredients targeted for analysis. These ‘inerts’ overwhelm the chemical burden from active pesticide, drug and personal care ingredients with which they are formulated. Honey bees serve as an optimal terrestrial bioindicator to determine if ‘the formulation and not just the dose makes the poison’.},

  abstract = {Dr. Fumio Matsumura's legacy embraced a passion for exploring environmental impacts of agrochemicals on non-target species such as bees. Why most formulations are more toxic to bees than respective active ingredients and how pesticides interact to cause pollinator decline cannot be answered without understanding the prevailing environmental chemical background to which bees are exposed. Modern pesticide formulations and seed treatments, particularly when multiple active ingredients are blended, require proprietary adjuvants and inert ingredients to achieve high efficacy for targeted pests. Although we have found over 130 different pesticides and metabolites in beehive samples, no individual pesticide or amount correlates with recent bee declines. Recently we have shown that honey bees are sensitive to organosilicone surfactants, nonylphenol polyethoxylates and the solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), widespread co-formulants used in agrochemicals and frequent pollutants within the beehive. Effects include learning impairment for adult bees and chronic toxicity in larval feeding bioassays. Multi-billion pounds of formulation ingredients like NMP are used and released into US environments. These synthetic organic chemicals are generally recognized as safe, have no mandated tolerances, and residues remain largely unmonitored. In contrast to finding about 70\% of the pesticide active ingredients searched for in our pesticide analysis of beehive samples, we have found 100\% of the other formulation ingredients targeted for analysis. These ‘inerts’ overwhelm the chemical burden from active pesticide, drug and personal care ingredients with which they are formulated. Honey bees serve as an optimal terrestrial bioindicator to determine if ‘the formulation and not just the dose makes the poison’.},

  abstract = {Programmed cell death (PCD) (including apoptosis) is an essential process, and many human diseases of high prevalence such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer are associated with deregulations in the cell death pathways. Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a unicellular eukaryotic organism, shares with multicellular organisms (including humans) key components and regulators of the PCD machinery. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge about cell death networks, including the modeling approaches and experimental strategies commonly used to study yeast cell death. We argue that the systems biology approach will bring valuable contributions to our understanding of regulations and mechanisms of the complex cell death pathways.},

The cytotoxic effect was also observed using trypan blue and the acridine orange/ethidium bromide fluorescence staining method to measure the apoptotic effect. It was observed that both of the insecticides had a cytotoxic effect at all the concentrations (p ≤ 0.001) and apoptotic effect for LCT at 15–30 μM (p ≤ 0.05; p ≤ 0.01) for CYP between 2 and 30 μM concentrations (p ≤ 0.05; p ≤ 0.01). The micronuclei that developed after exposure were induced because of an aneugenic effect (p ≤ 0.001). LCT and CYP might be spindle poisons or caused damaged to centromere/kinetochore function.},

Type I pyrethroids cause a type I poisoning syndrome or “T syndrome”, whereas type II pyrethroids induce a type II choreoathetosis syndrome, known as “CS syndrome”. The aim of the present work is to compare the effect of PERM and CY on erythrocyte plasma membrane fluidity of rats, treated orally for 60 days with low and high doses of these insecticides. The different modifications induced by pyrethroids on lipid peroxidation, osmotic fragility and the antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)) were measured. The data obtained show that PERM, which proved more permeable than CY, produced an increase of fluidity and polarity in the hydrophilic–hydrophobic region of the erythrocyte bilayer even at low doses. Also at high doses, filtering through the membrane more easily, the PERM influenced more markedly the intracellular enzymatic activity, compared with CY, reducing GPx activity and increasing SOD activity. Because of its hydrophilic character, CY limits oxidative damage in the erythrocyte cytosol at high doses.},

  abstract = {Recent studies showed that organophosphorus pesticides can increase incidence of metabolic disorders and diabetes. Considering the importance of pancreas in regulating blood glucose, the effect of malathion on essential elements of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in in vitro and in vivo conditions were evaluated. After dividing of rats into control and treatment groups, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was examined and then kinetic of glucose as well as pancreatic response to raise blood glucose were evaluated. After isolation of islets from pancreas, its function as well as oxidative stress markers and essential elements of GSIS were examined. Malathion at dose of 400mg/kg impaired GTT and increased AUC0–180min (P=0.047) and T1/2β of glucose (P=0.0016), and reduced insulin response (P=0.005) 30min after oral administering of glucose. In addition to impaired glucose tolerance, there were significant increases in lipid peroxidation (P{$<$}0.001), carbonyl groups (P=0.007) and 8-deoxyguanosine (P=0.011) as the biomarkers of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage to lipid, protein and DNA, respectively in islets. In static condition, a remarkable decrease was observed in ratio of insulin release/mM glucose (P{$<$}0.001) and a dramatic increase was seen in ROS formation at all glucose levels. Malathion only reduced ATP/ADP ratio in stimulating concentrations of glucose. Despite the dramatic reduction of glucokinase (GCK) mRNA expression (P=0.004), the expression of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) (P=0.01) was increased significantly. Conclusion Dysfunction of glucose metabolism and impairment of insulin secretion are associated with a depletion of energy and induction of oxidative stress following acute exposure to malathion.},

  abstract = {RNA-seq has become the standard tool for collecting genome-wide expression data in diverse fields, from quantitative genetics and medical genomics to ecology and developmental biology. However, RNA-seq library preparation is still prohibitive for many laboratories. Recently, the field of single-cell transcriptomics has reduced costs and increased throughput by adopting early barcoding and pooling of individual samples —producing a single final library containing all samples. In contrast, RNA-seq protocols where each sample is processed individually are significantly more expensive and lower throughput than single-cell approaches. Yet, many projects depend on individual library generation to preserve important samples or for follow-up re-sequencing experiments. Improving on currently available RNA-seq methods we have developed TM3′seq, a 3′-enriched library preparation protocol that uses Tn5 transposase and preserves sample identity at each step. TM3′seq is designed for high-throughput processing of individual samples (96 samples in 6h, with only 3h hands-on time) at a fraction of the cost of commercial kits (\$1.5 per sample). The protocol was tested in a range of human and Drosophila melanogaster RNA samples, recovering transcriptomes of the same quality and reliability than the commercial NEBNext kit. We expect that the cost- and time-efficient features of TM3′seq make large-scale RNA-seq experiments more permissive for the entire scientific community.},

To do this, first positive and negative icSARS gene panels were defined from GSEA-identified leading-edge genes between 500 genes from positive or negative tails of the GSE47960-derived icSARSvsmock signature and the GSE47961-derived icSARSvsmock signature, both from human cultures.

Non-random (null distribution p\&lt;0.001) significant enrichment (p\&lt;0.001) was observed between icSARS panels and all verification icSARSvsmock signatures derived from human cultures, from which 51 over- and 22 under-expressed genes were shared across leading-edges with 10 over-expressed genes already being associated with icSARS infection. For the icSARSvsmock mouse signature, significant, non-random enrichment (both p\&lt;0.001) held for only the positive icSARS panel, from which nine genes were shared with icSARS infection in human cultures. Considering other SARS strains, significant (p\&lt;0.01), non-random (p\&lt;0.002) enrichment was observed across signatures derived from other SARS strains for the positive icSARS panel.

  abstract = {The indiscriminate use of pesticides and herbicides to increase crop productivity has aroused a great concern among the environmental and health scientists due to their adverse effects in both target as well as non-target species. Although substantial information is available regarding their environmental and ecological impact, not much is known in regard to its toxicity in the mammalian system. Therefore a study was conducted for the assessment of cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of cypermethrin (Type II pyrethroid) dichlorvos (organophosphate) and pendimethalin (dinitroaniline herbicide) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. CHO cells were exposed to 1μM, 10μM, 100μM, 1000μM, and 10,000μM, cypermethrin, pendimethalin and dichlorvos for 3h and cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay. Their genotoxic potential was also evaluated by Comet assay. The results demonstrate that dichlorvos and pendimethalin exhibited higher extent of cytotoxicity as compared to cypermethrin. A significant (p{$<$}0.05) concentration dependent increase in DNA damage was observed with dichlorvos (0.01μM and above) and pendimethalin (0.1μM and above) as evident by Comet assay parameters viz., Olive tail moment (arbitrary units), tail DNA (\%) and tail length (μM). Cypermethrin induced a significant (p{$<$}0.05) DNA damage only at higher concentrations (1000 and 5000μM). Our data indicates that these chemicals produce cytotoxicity and DNA damage in mammalian cells and should be used with caution.},

The excessive stimulation of cholinergic receptors rapidly causes neuronal damage, seizures, death, and long-term neurological impairment in those that survive. Owing to the lethality of organophosphorus agents and the growing risk they pose, medical interventions that prevent organophosphate toxicity and the delayed injury response are much needed. Studies have shown that oxidative stress occurs in models of subacute, acute, and chronic exposure to organophosphate agents. Key findings of these studies include alterations in mitochondrial function and increased free radical–mediated injury, such as lipid peroxidation. This review focuses on the role of reactive oxygen species in organophosphate neurotoxicity and its dependence on seizure activity. Understanding the sources, mechanisms, and pathological consequences of organophosphate-induced oxidative stress can lead to the development of rational therapies for treating toxic exposures.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a study on the relation between the composition of larval food and the development of female castes in bumblebees. The first aim was to evaluate the significance of glandular secretions in the larval diet as a possible factor involved in larval feeding and caste differentiation. Small amounts of proteinaceous secretions were found to be added during the ingestion of sucrose but not while discharging food to the larvae. It is discussed that these secretions are digestive in function rather than food additives that would possibly play a role in the process of caste differentiation.¶Secondly, a comparative analysis was made of the general composition of food samples obtained from larvae of different castes and ages and from various periods in the social development of the colony. No significant differences in the total amount of pollen, sucrose and protein were detected between the castes or different age groups. Unlike honeybee workers, individual bumblebee workers did not change the composition of the diet they supplied to the brood in relation to their own age, nor to the social development of the colony. These findings suggest that all larvae receive the same nourishment during their total development and indicate that differences in development between queen larvae and worker larvae are neither caused by variations nor by a qualitative modification of their food with respect to the amount of pollen, protein and carbohydrates.},

Here, we briefly review pathways involved in lipid metabolism and its regulation, the regulatory network of general metabolic regulator Snf1 (and its human homologue AMPK) and the proteostasis network with its link to stress and cell death. All the mentioned pathways can be used as model systems for the study of homologous pathways in human cells and a failure in these pathways is directly linked to several human diseases such as the metabolic syndrome and neurodegeneration. We demonstrate how different yeast pathways are conserved in humans, and we discuss the possibilities of using the systems biology approach to study and compare the pathways of relevance with the objective to generate hypotheses and gain new insights.},

We investigated the chronic effects of deltamethrin on gonads by histopathological examination, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence using biomarkers for apoptosis (anti-p53, anti-H2A.XS139ph antibodies, and TUNEL assay), oxidative stress (anti-Cox4i1 antibody) and proliferation (anti-PCNA antibody). Among the histopathological changes, the apoptotic response was elevated in ovary and testis of deltamethrin exposed groups as it was seen in the IHC and IF for p53, H2A.XS139ph, and confirmed by TUNEL assay. These were observed in the case of all studied concentrations compared with the control group. Thereby, the gonadal tissue exhibited an up-regulated activity of this cell-death signaling markers, while the proliferation marker (PCNA) increased in the ovary due to its presence not only in primary growth and cortical-alveolar stage follicles but also in atretic follicles, meanwhile decreased notably in the testis. Cox4i1, a mitochondrial marker, decreased both in ovary and testis during deltamethrin treatment, probably inhibited by the overproduction of the free radicals after pesticide exposure.},

In vitro studies suggest that, in addition to its role in nervous system signaling, AChE can also modulate non-neuronal cell properties, although it remains controversial whether AChE functions in this capacity in vivo. Here, we show that AChE plays an essential non-classical role in vertebrate gut morphogenesis. Exposure of Xenopus embryos to AChE-inhibiting chemicals results in severe defects in intestinal development. Tissue-targeted loss-of-function assays (via microinjection of antisense morpholino or CRISPR-Cas9) confirm that AChE is specifically required in the gut endoderm tissue, a non-neuronal cell population, where it mediates adhesion to fibronectin and regulates cell rearrangement events that drive gut lengthening and digestive epithelial morphogenesis. Notably, the classical esterase activity of AChE is dispensable for this activity. As AChE is deeply conserved, widely expressed outside of the nervous system, and the target of many environmental chemicals, these results have wide-reaching implications for development and toxicology., Highlighted article: A non-classical function of acetylcholinesterase in the polarization, rearrangement and adhesion of endoderm cells during Xenopus gut morphogenesis is identified.},

Median residues of CGA322704 in pollen and nectar in the oilseed rape trials were all below the limit of quantification (1 µg/kg). Residues in the hive were even lower in both the maize and oilseed rape trials, being at or below the level of detection of 1 µg/kg for bee bread in the hive and at or below the level of detection of 0.5 µg/kg for hive nectar, honey and royal jelly samples. The long-term risk to honey bee colonies in the field was also investigated, including the sensitive overwintering stage, from four years consecutive single treatment crop exposures to flowering maize and oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam treated seeds at rates recommended for insect control. Throughout the study, mortality, foraging behavior, colony strength, colony weight, brood development and food storage levels were similar between treatment and control colonies. Detailed examination of brood development throughout the year demonstrated that colonies exposed to the treated crop were able to successfully overwinter and had a similar health status to the control colonies in the following spring. We conclude that these data demonstrate there is a low risk to honey bees from systemic residues in nectar and pollen following the use of thiamethoxam as a seed treatment on oilseed rape and maize.},

  abstract = {Background: Besides their nectar and pollen collecting activities, honey bees also forage water. Guttation droplets may be used as a water source. Measurements of high residue levels of some intrinsically highly toxic, systemic insecticides in guttation droplets triggered research activities on the potential risk for honey bees. Since 2009, a large number of studies have been conducted on the environmental conditions and factors favoring guttation, foraging of guttation, the occurrence of guttation in different crops, the frequency of guttation events and residue measurements in guttation droplets in different crops, at different growth stages and with different active ingredients. Different approaches of laboratory, semi-field and field studies were set up to address the potential risk of guttation to bees and to gain clarification whether and how this concern would need to be specifically addressed in the risk assessment for bees. Results: Occasionally increased mortalities of worker bees were reported from single events in some trials, when colonies were placed directly next to the sown maize crop treated with a systemic insecticide. However, there were no long-term colony effects (e.g. on colony strength and brood development) reported from any of the realistic worst case exposure trials conducted by either public research institutes or industry. Conclusion: The potential risk for bees is in the first instance dependent on the distance of the colonies to treated crops. Maize is considered as the worst case crop in terms of frequency, duration and intensity of guttation and of residue level of compounds found in guttation liquid. Though increased worker bee mortality on individual days was seen in some of the field studies where hives were placed directly at guttating maize fields, adverse effects to colony vitality, colony and brood development were never observed.},

Various methods of chemical prevention of commercial winter and spring oilseed rape crops in field-realistic conditions were taken into account in the assessment. Pesticides were applied in accordance with the actual agricultural practice. Commercial crop protection products with thiamethoxam, clothianidin or imidacloprid were used as seed treatment. Formulations containing acetamiprid or thiacloprid were used for spraying. Fifteen healthy bee colonies were placed in close proximity to each of the oilseed rape fields throughout the blooming period. During florescence, the samples of nectar (directly from flowers and nectar flow from combs) and pollen loads were collected repeatedly. Samples of honey, bee bread and adult bees were taken one week after the end of plants flowering. To ensure high specificity and sensitivity of analysed pestcicides modified QuEChERS extraction method and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used. The five of neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiametoxam, acetamiprid and thiacloprid) were analyzed in multi-residue method with 0.1 - 10 ng/g limits of detection. Palynological analysis was done to determine the botanical origin of the nectar, honey and pollen. Development of bee colonies (brood area, worker biomass, colony health) was assessed every 3 weeks until the end of the beekeeping season. The amount of pollen collected by bees per hive, bee bread area and rape honey yield was also measured. The long-term effects of insecticides on bees were estimated using the same methods in April of the following year. {$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}All the neonicotinoid insecticides applied to control oilseed rape pests were present in the samples of nectar and pollen. Their residue levels were lower than the acute oral and contact LD50 values. Among five examined neonicotinoids, the most frequently detected were: thiamethoxam, thiacloprid and acetamiprid. These substances were present in 65, 64, and 51\% of the nectar samples and in 37, 62, and 45\% of the pollen samples, respectively. The highest level of residues were noted after the thiamethoxam seed treatment; on average, 4.2 and 3.8 ng/g in the nectar and pollen samples. In the nectar and pollen samples from winter rape fields, lower levels of neonicotinoid residues were found in comparison to spring rape samples. The contaminations of neonicotinoids applied as seed dressing in nectar samples were significantly higher in comparison to the pollen samples. No negative effects of neonicotinoids on the bee mortality, brood development, strength, and honey yield of healthy bee colonies were found throughout the study period. However, the risk exposure of bee colonies on adverse impact of pesticide residues is high in areas of intensively cultivated oilseed rape.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Experimental evidence shows little correlation between the renal tubular necrosis and the degree of OP-induced acetylcholinesterase inhibition, the main mechanism of OP's toxicity, suggesting the involvement of alternate mechanisms. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known mediators of many toxin-induced renal injuries, this study was conducted to investigate whether ROS play a role in Bidrin (BD)-induced renal tubular epithelial cell (LLC-PK1) toxicity. BD is an OP insecticide formulation with dicrotophos as the active ingredient. LLC-PK1 cell death, determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (\% of total), rose concentration- and time-dependently after exposure of the cells to 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, and 2000 ppm of BD for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. Antioxidants 2-methylaminochroman (2-MAC; 0.3 to 2.5 microM) and desferrioxamine (DFO; 0.25 to 2 mM) reduced cell damage induced by 1250 ppm of BD over a 24-h incubation in a concentration-related manner. The greatest reductions in \% LDH were produced by DFO 2 mM and 2-MAC 2.5 microM, both significantly lower than BD alone. H2O2 levels (micromol/mg protein per h) were significantly elevated after exposure to 1250 ppm of BD. Significantly increased malondialdehyde formation (nmol/mg protein) compared with control was also found in BD-exposed cells indicating enhanced lipid peroxidation. Malondialdehyde generation was significantly suppressed by 2-MAC and DFO. These results demonstrate that the organophosphate BD can cause direct tubular cytotoxicity, and implicate, at least in part, a role for ROS and accompanying lipid peroxidation in cytotoxicity. Based on these direct in vitro findings, it is hypothesized that, besides hypotension that often accompanies OP intoxication, OP-induced oxidative stress at the tubular level may play a role in the pathogenesis of acute tubular necrosis.},

  abstract = {Malathion is an insecticide of the group of organophosphate pesticides (OPs), which shows strong insecticidal effects. However, it possesses mutagenic and carcinogenic properties and shows organ-specific toxicity in relation to the heart, kidney and other vertebrate organs. The exact mechanism of the genotoxic effects of malathion is not yet known. Free radical damage is an important direct or indirect factor in several pathological and toxicological processes, including malathion poisoning. The aim of the present study was the evaluation of oxidative damage in different tissues of Wistar rats, administered intra peritoneally at doses of 25, 50, 100 and 150mgmalathion/kg, after acute and sub-chronic malathion exposure. Oxidative stress evaluation was based on lipid peroxidation by levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), protein oxidation by levels of carbonyl groups, and also on the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, two antioxidant enzymes that detoxity superoxide radical (O2−) and hydrogen peroxide, respectively. The results showed that the most sensitive targets of oxidative damage were kidney, lung and diaphragm after acute treatment, and liver, quadriceps and serum after sub-chronic treatment. Also, in general, increased lipid peroxidation measured as TBARS levels seems to be a better biomarker of oxidative stress compared to the contents of protein carbonyls after acute and sub-chronic malathion treatments. The present findings reinforce the concept that oxidative stress and particularly lipoperoxidation, are involved in OPs toxicity.},

  abstract = {Background Epidemiological studies link organophosphorus pesticide (OP) exposures to asthma, and we have shown that the OPs chlorpyrifos, diazinon and parathion cause airway hyperreactivity in guinea pigs 24 hr after a single subcutaneous injection. OP-induced airway hyperreactivity involves M2 muscarinic receptor dysfunction on airway nerves independent of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, but how OPs inhibit neuronal M2 receptors in airways is not known. In the central nervous system, OPs interact directly with neurons to alter muscarinic receptor function or expression; therefore, in this study we tested whether the OP parathion or its oxon metabolite, paraoxon, might decrease M2 receptor function on peripheral neurons via similar direct mechanisms. Methodology/Principal Findings Intravenous administration of paraoxon, but not parathion, caused acute frequency-dependent potentiation of vagally-induced bronchoconstriction and increased electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions in isolated trachea independent of AChE inhibition. However, paraoxon had no effect on vagally-induced bradycardia in intact guinea pigs or EFS-induced contractions in isolated ileum, suggesting mechanisms other than pharmacologic antagonism of M2 receptors. Paraoxon did not alter M2 receptor expression in cultured cells at the mRNA or protein level as determined by quantitative RT-PCR and radio-ligand binding assays, respectively. Additionally, a biotin-labeled fluorophosphonate, which was used as a probe to identify molecular targets phosphorylated by OPs, did not phosphorylate proteins in guinea pig cardiac membranes that were recognized by M2 receptor antibodies. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that neither direct pharmacologic antagonism nor downregulated expression of M2 receptors contributes to OP inhibition of M2 function in airway nerves, adding to the growing evidence of non-cholinergic mechanisms of OP neurotoxicity.},

  abstract = {Varroa mites often inflict heavy losses on the global bee industry and there are few effective control options. Among these methods to control mites, pesticides are extensively used as a cheap, easy to use, and high-efficiency control measure. However, bees are sensitive to many pesticides; thus, a balance between losses induced by drugs and maximum benefits are important for beekeeping and risk assessment. In this study, the effects of flumethrin, a pyrethroid miticide used on bee colonies, was evaluated using bee larvae reared in vitro. We found that flumethrin induced significant mortality during larval metamorphosis and adult emergence. After continuous exposure during the larval stage, significant changes were observed in antioxidative enzymes (SOD and CAT), lipid peroxidation (MDA, LPO, and POD), and detoxification enzymes (GSH, GST, and GR) in the late instar larvae before pupation. It is also noteworthy that flumethrin significantly regulated the expression of immune (Basket and Dscam) and developmental (Amems, Amhex10869, Vtg and Mfe) genes in larvae, which influences can also be found in the subsequent pupae and adult stages. These findings indicate that flumethrin itself is toxic to bee larvae and has potential risks during colony development. Bees are important pollinators and the sustainable and healthy development of colonies is the foundation of pollinating success for agricultural production. This study would provide some useful thinking for pesticides application techniques and processes in risk assessment of pesticides to bee larvae, even colony.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Organophosphorus (OP) insecticide self-poisoning is a global problem, killing tens of thousands of people every year. Oxidative stress has been proposed to play a pathological role in OP poisoning, but whether it plays a direct toxic role is currently unclear.Objectives: To determine whether there is consistent evidence of oxidative stress in patients with acute OP insecticide self-poisoning, and whether there are animal or human trial data that indicate that treatment of oxidative stress provides clinical benefit, which would suggest a direct toxic effect of oxidative stress.Methods: We conducted a systematic review using the PubMed, EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews, based upon the following search terms and keywords: "organophosphate poisoning", "oxidative stress" and "antioxidant". All articles relevant to the aims of the study were included. Articles related to chronic OP poisoning, to use of medicines without antioxidant benefits, or to subjects other than oxidative stress were excluded. The search returned 256 results of which 17 studies were considered relevant and grouped under the following categories: observational human studies (n\,=\,11) and intervention studies in animals (n\,=\,4) and humans (n\,=\,2).Oxidative stress markers in human studies: Oxidative damage to lipids and proteins was reported in all eleven human studies. Eight of nine studies reported variable increases in a weak marker of lipid peroxidation, malondialdehyde. In two case-control studies, erythrocyte membrane malondialdehyde concentrations were 380\% and 160\% higher in cases than controls, while plasma malondialdehyde concentrations were ∼63\% higher in cases than controls in three case-control studies. In a prospective study, plasma malondialdehyde did not increase significantly from baseline in moderate or severely poisoned patients. Five case-control studies measured thiol residues as markers of protein oxidative damage and found variable changes after poisoning. No evidence of oxidative DNA damage was found in the one study that investigated it.Antioxidant intervention studies in animals: After treatment with an antioxidant, all four studies showed an improvement in either markers of oxidative damage or antioxidant activity. One mouse study with a relatively low risk of bias showed that administration of acetylcysteine 200\,mg/kg reduced malondialdehyde by 35\% and increased survival by more than 60\%.Antioxidant intervention studies in humans: We found two small randomised controlled trials reporting the use of acetylcysteine as an adjunct to standard treatment in acute OP poisoning. The trials found that acetylcysteine reduced atropine requirements by 77\% and 55\%, but did not affect clinically relevant outcomes.Conclusions: Several studies showed evidence of OP insecticide-induced oxidative damage and antioxidant activity, suggesting that endogenous antioxidant defences are triggered in acute OP poisoning. However, the markers of lipid peroxidation used were weak, there was high inter-individual variability between studies in results and quality, and marked variation between the OP insecticides involved. Animal data provide some evidence that antioxidants alleviate adverse effects of acute poisoning, suggesting that oxidative stress may directly cause clinical harm. Acetylcysteine appeared beneficial in animal studies, but this could be mediated via increased synthesis of the endogenous detoxifying agent, glutathione, rather than through a direct antioxidant effect. The two human clinical studies were too small to provide any clear evidence to support the use of acetylcysteine in OP poisoning. Further research into the mechanisms of oxidative stress in acute OP poisoning, combined with large unambiguous clinical trials of antioxidants, are required before they can be used routinely in treatment.},

Controls were age-matched workers of a food-making factory. They were evaluated for oxidative stress markers, including thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) indicator of lipid peroxidation (LPO), ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) indicator of total anti-oxidant capacity, total thiol (SH) groups and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels in blood and AChE activity in erythrocytes. The results show marked inhibition of AChE activity, increased TBARS, decreased FRAP and decreased thiol group levels in workers. The reduction in activity of AChE correlated well with increased TBARS and decreased FRAP in OP formulators. It is concluded that OP-formulating workers are exposed to more oxidative stress. The measurement of erythrocyte AChE activity in pesticide workers who formulate OPs can be a good monitoring factor and is recommended to be performed in a regular manner.},

Although the toxicological implications from human exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) are well established, data on lesser-understood PFAS are limited. New approach methodologies (NAMs) that apply bioinformatic tools to high-throughput data are being increasingly considered to inform risk assessment for data-poor chemicals. The aim of this investigation was to identify biological response potencies (i.e., benchmark concentrations: BMCs) following PFAS exposures to inform read-across for risk assessment of data-poor PFAS. Gene expression changes were measured in primary human liver cell microtissues (i.e., 3D spheroids) after 1-day and 10-day exposures to increasing concentrations of 23 PFAS. The cells were treated with four subgroups of PFAS: carboxylates (PFCAs), sulfonates (PFSAs), fluorotelomers, and sulfonamides. An established pipeline to identify differentially expressed genes and transcriptomic BMCs was applied. We found that both PFCAs and PFSAs exhibited a trend toward increased transcriptional changes with carbon chain-length. Specifically, longer-chain compounds (7 to 10 carbons) were more likely to induce changes in gene expression, and have lower transcriptional BMCs. The combined high-throughput transcriptomic and bioinformatic analyses supports the capability of NAMs to efficiently assess the effects of PFAS in liver microtissues. The data enable potency ranking of PFAS for human liver cell spheroid cytotoxicity and transcriptional changes, and assessment of \emph{in vitro} transcriptomic points of departure. These data improve our understanding of the health effects of PFAS and will be used to inform read-across for human health risk assessment.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris audax is an important pollinator within both landscape ecosystems and agricultural crops. During their lifetime bumblebees are regularly challenged by various environmental stressors including insecticides. Historically the honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) has been used as an ‘indicator’ species for ‘standard’ ecotoxicological testing, but it has been suggested that it is not always a good proxy for other eusocial or solitary bees. To investigate this, the susceptibility of B. terrestris to selected pesticides within the neonicotinoid, pyrethroid and organophosphate classes was examined using acute insecticide bioassays. Acute oral and topical LD50 values for B. terrestris against these insecticides were broadly consistent with published results for A. mellifera. For the neonicotinoids, imidacloprid was highly toxic, but thiacloprid and acetamiprid were practically non-toxic. For pyrethroids, deltamethrin was highly toxic, but tau-fluvalinate only slightly toxic. For the organophosphates, chlorpyrifos was highly toxic, but coumaphos practically non-toxic. Bioassays using insecticides with common synergists enhanced the sensitivity of B. terrestris to several insecticides, suggesting detoxification enzymes may provide a level of protection against these compounds. The sensitivity of B. terrestris to compounds within three different insecticide classes is similar to that reported for honey bees, with marked variation in sensitivity to different insecticides within the same insecticide class observed in both species. This finding highlights the need to consider each compound within an insecticide class in isolation rather than extrapolating between different insecticides in the same class or sharing the same mode of action.},

Recent evidence suggests that the US Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has a positive impact on environmental suitability for supporting honey bee apiaries. However, relatively little is known about the influence of habitat conservation efforts on honey bee colony health. Identifying specific factors that influence bee health at the colony level incorporates longitudinal monitoring of physiology across diverse environments. Using a pooled-sampling method to overcome individual variation, we monitored colony-level molecular biomarkers during critical pre- and post-winter time points. Major categories of colony health (nutrition, oxidative stress resistance, and immunity) were impacted by apiary site. In general, apiaries within foraging distance of CRP lands showed improved performance and higher gene expression of vitellogenin (vg), a nutritionally regulated protein with central storage and regulatory functions. Mirroring vg levels, gene transcripts encoding antioxidant enzymes and immune-related proteins were typically higher in colonies exposed to CRP environments. Our study highlights the potential of CRP lands to improve pollinator health and the utility of colony-level molecular diagnostics to assess environmental suitability for honey bees.},

  abstract = {Exposure to pesticides is a potential concern for pollinators that may forage on plants containing residues. A key element of estimating dietary risk to pollinators is to determine the nature and amount of food consumed by individuals. Recent efforts have focused on honey bees (Apis mellifera), of which nectar foragers are thought to be at greatest risk of dietary exposure due to their foraging behavior and high energy requirements for the flight-foraging activities. At upper tiers of pesticide risk assessment for honey bees, field studies with whole colonies are carried out to gauge effects of expected exposures; however, without knowing how much nectar and pollen is being consumed by colonies and the potential variability in these parameters, it is difficult to accurately assess risk under other untested exposure scenarios. The objective of this review was to collate available data from the literature regarding (1) the quantity of nectar required by nectar foragers and (2) the quantities of nectar, pollen, and supplements that are consumed by colonies; the purposes being to develop a database that can be used to improve exposure and risk assessments, and to identify data gaps for further research. A number of studies investigating honey bee energetics have been identified that can be used to estimate sugar requirements for foragers under different conditions (e.g., resting, flying). A few more recent studies have been able to quantify the amount of time foragers spend outside the hive. Factors requiring further investigation include levels of energy expenditure while outside the hive, and the sugar content of available nectars, which may also affect foraging behavior. At the colony level, data on food consumption are sparse and primarily anecdotal. Colony size, management, and location seem to be major factors contributing to differences in nectar foraging and honey production. Further research is needed to better quantify and predict colony use and storage of food resources.},

Thus, dogma indicates that the target of OP pesticides is AChE, but many authors postulate that these compounds also disturb cellular redox processes, and change the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Interestingly, it has also been reported that oxidative stress plays also a role in the regulation and activity of AChE. The aims of this study were to determine the effects of the antioxidant, vitamin C (VC), the oxidant, t-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) and the organophosphate Chlorpyrifos (CPF), on AChE gene transcription and activity in zebrafish embryos after 72h exposure. In addition, oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring antioxidant enzymes activities and transcription, and quantification of total glutathione. Apical effects on the development of zebrafish embryos were also measured. With the exception of AChE inhibition and enhanced gene expression, limited effects of CPF on oxidative stress and apical endpoints were found at this developmental stage. Addition of VC had little effect on oxidative stress or AChE, but increased pericardial area and heartbeat rate through an unknown mechanism. TBOOH diminished AChE gene expression and activity, and caused oxidative stress when administered alone. However, in combination with CPF, only reductions in AChE activity were observed with no significant changes in oxidative stress suggesting the adverse apical endpoints in the embryos may have been due to AChE inhibition by CPF rather than oxidative stress. These results give additional evidence to support the role of prooxidants in AChE activity and expression.},

The large-scale loss of bees has considerable implications for the agricultural economy because bees are one of the leading pollinators of numerous crops. Bee declines have been associated with several interactive factors. Recent studies suggest nutritional and pathogen stress can interactively contribute to bee physiological declines, but the molecular mechanisms underlying interactive effects remain unknown. In this study, we provide insight into this question by using RNA-sequencing to examine how monofloral diets and Israeli acute paralysis virus inoculation influence gene expression patterns in bees.},

  abstract = {Sacbrood virus (SBV) and Deformed wing virus (DWV) are evolutionarily related positive-strand RNA viruses, members of the Iflavirus group. They both infect the honeybee Apis mellifera but have strikingly different levels of virulence when transmitted orally. Honeybee larvae orally infected with SBV usually accumulate high levels of the virus, which halts larval development and causes insect death. In contrast, oral DWV infection at the larval stage usually causes asymptomatic infection with low levels of the virus, although high doses of ingested DWV could lead to DWV replicating to high levels. We investigated effects of DWV and SBV infection on the transcriptome of honeybee larvae and pupae using global RNA-Seq and real-time PCR analysis. This showed that high levels of SBV replication resulted in down-regulation of the genes involved in cuticle and muscle development, together with changes in expression of putative immune-related genes. In particular, honeybee larvae with high levels of SBV replication, with and without high levels of DWV replication, showed concerted up-regulated expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and down-regulated expression of the prophenoloxidase activating enzyme (PPAE) together with up-regulation of the expression of a putative serpin, which could lead to the suppression of the melanisation pathway. The effects of high SBV levels on expression of these immune genes were unlikely to be a consequence of SBV-induced developmental changes, because similar effects were observed in honeybee pupae infected by injection. In the orally infected larvae with high levels of DWV replication alone we observed no changes of AMPs or of gene expression in the melanisation pathway. In the injected pupae, high levels of DWV alone did not alter expression of the tested melanisation pathway genes, but resulted in up-regulation of the AMPs, which could be attributed to the effect of DWV on the regulation of AMP expression in response to wounding. We propose that the difference in expression of the honeybee immune genes induced by SBV and DWV may be an evolutionary adaptation to the different predominant transmission routes used by these viruses.},

  abstract = {Although they were used historically as antimicrobial agents, there is a modern requirement to devise organic solvent systems for exploitation in the biotransformation by intact cells of substrates that are poorly soluble in water. Water-immiscible solvents are normally less cytotoxic than are water-miscible ones. While a unitary mechanism is excluded, damage to the membrane remains the likeliest major mechanism of cytotoxicity, and may be conveniently assessed using an electronic biomass probe. Studies designed to account for the mechanisms of action of general anesthetics and of uncouplers parallel those designed to account for the cytotoxicity of organic solvents. Although there are hundreds of potential physical descriptors of solvent properties, many are broadly similar to each other, such that the intrinsic dimensionality of solvent space is relatively small ({$<$}10). This opens up the possibility of providing a rational biophysical basis for the optimization of the solvents used for biotransformations. The widely used descriptor of solvent behavior, log P (the octanol:water partition coefficient), is a composite of more fundamental molecular descriptors; this explains why there are rarely good correlations between cytotoxicity and log P when a wide variety of solvents is studied. Although the intrinsic dimensionality of solvent space is relatively small, pure solvents still populate it rather sparsely. Thus, mixtures of solvents can and do provide the opportunity of obtaining a solvent optimal for a biotransformation of interest.},

The IC50 values for malathion and malaoxon were estimated to be approximately 60 and 45 mM, respectively. Additional kinetic studies showed this inhibition to be competitive or partially competitive with respect to the synthetic (collagen) peptide, partially uncompetitive with respect to Fe2+, and partially noncompetitive with respect to ascorbic acid. The calculated values for the Ki were consistent with the IC50 values. Allosteric effects were not found for any of the cofactors tested, the peptide substrate, or the inhibitors. Interactions were found to be unimolecular for lysyl hydroxylase and its substrate and cofactors as well as for the inhibitors malathion and malaoxon. A computer search of a protein structure database showed an unexpected region of partial homology between the active site sequence of acetylcholinesterase and a segment of lysyl hydroxylase, suggesting a possible molecular basis for these observations. These results suggest the possibility of a novel and hitherto unexpected class of inhibitors of lysyl hydroxylase, based on the organophosphate structure, that might be of value for testing as antifibrotic drugs.},

  abstract = {The widespread use of systemic neonicotinoid insecticides in agriculture results first in contamination of the soil of the treated crops, and secondly in the transfer of residues to the aquatic environment. The high toxicity of these insecticides to aquatic insects and other arthropods has been recognised, but there is little awareness of the impacts these chemicals have on aquatic environments and the ecosystem at large. Recent monitoring studies in several countries, however, have revealed a world-wide contamination of creeks, rivers and lakes with these insecticides, with residue levels in the low μg/L (ppb) range. The current extent of aquatic contamination by neonicotinoids is reviewed first, and the findings contrasted with the known acute and chronic toxicity of neonicotinoids to various aquatic organisms. Impacts on populations and aquatic communities, mostly using mesocosms, are reviewed next to identify the communities most at risk from those that undergo little or no impact. Finally, the ecological links between aquatic and terrestrial organisms are considered. The consequences for terrestrial vertebrate species that depend mainly on this food source are discussed together with impacts on ecosystem function. Gaps in knowledge stem from difficulties in obtaining long-term experimental data that relates the effects on individual organisms to impacts on populations and ecosystems. The paper concludes with a summary of findings and the implications they have for the larger ecosystem.},

For most diet items, these values are based on a large number of residue studies. However, the default residues per unit dose (RUD; standardized for application of 1 kg substance per hectare) values for fruits were taken from a few literature trials of unclear relevance for regulatory purposes. These trials were conducted according to neither current European Union (EU) agricultural practice nor to recommendations given in the GD about how to conduct wildlife-relevant residue studies. Therefore, field study data on fruit residue levels from applications of pesticides in fruiting crops were compiled and evaluated. Corresponding studies had been conducted during the last 26 y in the EU. In the final data set, 291 studies provided 1002 residue values in different fruits, including grapes, berries (currants, raspberries, gooseberries), fruits from orchards (apple, peach, pear, lemon, mandarin, orange, apricot, cherry, plum), gourds (pumpkins, cucumbers, squash, melons), and strawberries. This data set provides a basis for revising registration-relevant RUD values for fruits as potential diet items for birds and mammals in environmental wildlife risk assessments. The objective of this study was to estimate the resulting residue levels in different fruits determined under field conditions following the application of pesticides across their growing areas within the EU in diverse climatic areas that can be used directly in wildlife risk assessments. The large data set of usually about more than 100 residue values per “fruit group,” all evaluated at EU member state level, revealed significantly lower RUDs compared to the current default RUDs presented in the GD. These new RUD values for fruits should be considered for use as default values in future bird and mammal risk assessments and in respective guidance documents.

  abstract = {Populations of pollinators are in decline worldwide. These declines are best documented in honey bees and are due to a combination of stressors. In particular, pesticides have been linked to decreased longevity and performance in honey bees; however, the molecular and physiological pathways mediating sensitivity and resistance to pesticides are not well characterized. We explored the impact of coumaphos and fluvalinate, the two most abundant and frequently detected pesticides in the hive, on genome-wide gene expression patterns of honey bee workers. We found significant changes in 1118 transcripts, including genes involved in detoxification, behavioral maturation, immunity, and nutrition. Since behavioral maturation is regulated by juvenile hormone III (JH), we examined effects of these miticides on hormone titers; while JH titers were unaffected, titers of methyl farnesoate (MF), the precursor to JH, were decreased. We further explored the association between nutrition- and pesticide-regulated gene expression patterns and demonstrated that bees fed a pollen-based diet exhibit reduced sensitivity to a third pesticide, chlorpyrifos. Finally, we demonstrated that expression levels of several of the putative pesticide detoxification genes identified in our study and previous studies are also upregulated in response to pollen feeding, suggesting that these pesticides and components in pollen modulate similar molecular response pathways. Our results demonstrate that pesticide exposure can substantially impact expression of genes involved in several core physiological pathways in honey bee workers. Additionally, there is substantial overlap in responses to pesticides and pollen-containing diets at the transcriptional level, and subsequent analyses demonstrated that pollen-based diets reduce workers’ pesticide sensitivity. Thus, providing honey bees and other pollinators with high quality nutrition may improve resistance to pesticides.},

Oxidant-based DNA damage and DNA damage response (DDR) were also observed, namely the formation of micronuclei, DNA double-strand breaks and slightly elevated recruitment of p53 binding protein (53BP1) foci. Our results contribute to the elucidation of insecticide effects on animal lymphocyte cultures after short-term exposure.

  abstract = {Deltamethrin (DEL) and thiacloprid (THIA) are two insecticides that are widely used in agriculture either separately or in combination. Studies on genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of TIA and the mixture of DEL and THIA insecticides have not been reported so far. Therefore, we investigated the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of commercial formulations DEL and/or THIA in rat bone marrow cells, using mitotic index (MI), micronucleus (MN) and chromosome aberrations (CA) assay. In vivo cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay using cytochalasin-B in bone marrow cells was performed for the first time in this study. Rats were orally gavaged with a single dose of DEL (15 mg/kg), THIA (112.5 mg/kg) or DEL + THIA (15 + 112.5 mg/kg) for 24 h (acute treatments), or DEL (3 mg/kg/day), THIA (22.5 mg/kg/day) or DEL + THIA (3 + 22.5 mg/kg/day) for 30 days (subacute treatments). A corn oil vehicle control group and cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg) positive control group were also included. All DEL and/or THIA treatments significantly decreased MI and binucleated (BN) cell numbers, and significantly increased CA, as compared to the vehicle control group. The results of CBMN assay indicated that the combination of DEL and THIA for both treatment times and the 30-day treatment with THIA alone caused a significant increase in micronucleus formation in BN cells. The present findings indicated the combined exposure of DEL and THIA showed genotoxic and cytotoxic effects more than those of individual exposure of DEL or THIA in rat bone marrow cells. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Neonicotinoids are a relatively new type of insecticide to control a variety of pests. Although they are generally considered to be safe, they can lead to harmful effects on human and environmental health. We aimed to investigate possible effects of common neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) on cytotoxicity and DNA damage in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Our results indicated that 50\% of inhibitory concentration values of neonicotinoids are in the range of 0.96 to {$>$}4 mM in SH-SY5Y cells and 0.53 to {$>$}4 mM in HepG2 cells by the methyl tetrazolium and neutral red uptake tests after 24 and 48 h exposure. We observed significant DNA damage at 500 µM of five neonicotinoids in SHSY-5Y cells, while only imidacloprid, thiametoxam, and thiacloprid showed some alterations in HepG2 cells after 24 h exposure using the alkaline comet assay. In conclusion, neonicotinoid insecticides may induce cytotoxicity and DNA damage in cell cultures; therefore, further studies are needed to better understand the toxicity of neonicotinoids.},

  abstract = {The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is now recognized as a model system representing a simple eukaryote whose genome can be easily manipulated. Yeast has only a slightly greater genetic complexity than bacteria and shares many of the technical advantages that permitted rapid progress in the molecular genetics of prokaryotes and their viruses. Some of the properties that make yeast particularly suitable for biological studies include rapid growth, dispersed cells, the ease of replica plating and mutant isolation, a well-defined genetic system, and most important, a highly versatile DNA transformation system. Being nonpathogenic, yeast can be handled with little precautions. Large quantities of normal baker's yeast are commercially available and can provide a cheap source for biochemical studies. The development of DNA transformation has made yeast particularly accessible to gene cloning and genetic engineering techniques. Structural genes corresponding to virtually any genetic trait can be identified by complementation from plasmid libraries. Plasmids can be introduced into yeast cells either as replicating molecules or by integration into the genome. In contrast to most other organisms, integrative recombination of transforming DNA in yeast proceeds exclusively via homologous recombination. Cloned yeast sequences, accompanied by foreign sequences on plasmids, can therefore be directed at will to specific locations in the genome.},

  abstract = {Neonicotinoid insecticides are now the most widely used insecticides in the world. Previous studies have indicated that sublethal doses of neonicotinoids impair learning, memory capacity, foraging, and immunocompetence in honey bees (Apis mellifera, Linnaeus) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Despite these, few studies have been carried out on the molecular effects of neonicotinoids. In this study, we focus on the second-generation neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, which is currently widely used in agriculture to protect crops. Using high-throughput RNA-Seq, we investigated the transcriptome profile of honey bees after subchronic exposure to 10 ppb thiamethoxam over 10 d. In total, 609 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 225 were upregulated and 384 were downregulated. Several genes, including vitellogenin, CSP3, defensin-1, Mrjp1, and Cyp6as5 were selected and further validated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. The functions of some DEGs were identified, and Gene Ontology-enrichment analysis showed that the enriched DEGs were mainly linked to metabolism, biosynthesis, and translation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that thiamethoxam affected biological processes including ribosomes, the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, tyrosine metabolism pathway, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and drug metabolism. Overall, our results provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the complex interactions between neonicotinoid insecticides and honey bees.},

At present, little is known about how honey bees respond to pesticide stresses during the continuous development period. This study aims to examine effects of long-term acetamiprid exposure on the development and survival of honey bees, and further present the expression profile in larvae, 1-day-old, and 7-day-old adult worker bees that related to immune, detoxification, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and memory. Honey bees from 2-day-old larvae to 14-day-old adults except the pupal stage were continuously fed with different acetamiprid solutions (0, 5, and 25~mg/L). We found that acetamiprid over 5~mg/L disturbed the development involving birth weight and emergence rate of newly emerged bees, and reduced the proportion of capped cells of larvae at 25~mg/L; gene expression related to immune and detoxification of worker bees exposed to acetamiprid was roughly activated, returned and then inhibited from larval to emerged and to the late adult stage, respectively. Moreover, lifespans of bees treated with acetamiprid at 25~mg/L were significantly reduced. The present study reflects the potential risk for honey bees continuously exposed to acetamiprid in the development stage.},

  abstract = {Since their discovery in the late 1980s, neonicotinoid pesticides have become the most widely used class of insecticides worldwide, with large-scale applications ranging from plant protection (crops, vegetables, fruits), veterinary products, and biocides to invertebrate pest control in fish farming. In this review, we address the phenyl-pyrazole fipronil together with neonicotinoids because of similarities in their toxicity, physicochemical profiles, and presence in the environment. Neonicotinoids and fipronil currently account for approximately one third of the world insecticide market; the annual world production of the archetype neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, was estimated to be ca. 20,000~tonnes active substance in 2010. There were several reasons for the initial success of neonicotinoids and fipronil: (1) there was no known pesticide resistance in target pests, mainly because of their recent development, (2) their physicochemical properties included many advantages over previous generations of insecticides (i.e., organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, etc.), and (3) they shared an assumed reduced operator and consumer risk. Due to their systemic nature, they are taken up by the roots or leaves and translocated to all parts of the plant, which, in turn, makes them effectively toxic to herbivorous insects. The toxicity persists for a variable period of time—depending on the plant, its growth stage, and the amount of pesticide applied. A wide variety of applications are available, including the most common prophylactic non-Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) application by seed coating. As a result of their extensive use and physicochemical properties, these substances can be found in all environmental compartments including soil, water, and air. Neonicotinoids and fipronil operate by disrupting neural transmission in the central nervous system of invertebrates. Neonicotinoids mimic the action of neurotransmitters, while fipronil inhibits neuronal receptors. In doing so, they continuously stimulate neurons leading ultimately to death of target invertebrates. Like virtually all insecticides, they can also have lethal and sublethal impacts on non-target organisms, including insect predators and vertebrates. Furthermore, a range of synergistic effects with other stressors have been documented. Here, we review extensively their metabolic pathways, showing how they form both compound-specific and common metabolites which can themselves be toxic. These may result in prolonged toxicity. Considering their wide commercial expansion, mode of action, the systemic properties in plants, persistence and environmental fate, coupled with limited information about the toxicity profiles of these compounds and their metabolites, neonicotinoids and fipronil may entail significant risks to the environment. A global evaluation of the potential collateral effects of their use is therefore timely. The present paper and subsequent chapters in this review of the global literature explore these risks and show a growing body of evidence that persistent, low concentrations of these insecticides pose serious risks of undesirable environmental impacts.},

We addressed to what extent complex I, III and IV,respectively, should be inhibited to cause ROS generation. For inhibition of complex I, III and IV, rotenone, antimycin and cyanide were used, respectively, and ROS formation was followed by measuring the activity of aconitase enzyme. ROS formation was not detected until complex III was inhibited by up to 71 +/- 4\%, above that threshold inhibition, decrease in aconitase activity indicated an enhanced ROS generation. Similarly, threshold inhibition of complex IV caused an accelerated ROS production. By contrast, inactivation of complex I to a small extent (16 +/- 2\%) resulted in a significant increase in ROS formation, and no clear threshold inhibition could be determined. However, the magnitude of ROS generated at complex I when it is completely inhibited is smaller than that observed when complex III or complex IV was fully inactivated. Our findings may add a novel aspect to the pathology of Parkinson's disease, showing that a moderate level of complex I inhibition characteristic in Parkinson's disease leads to significant ROS formation. The amount of ROS generated by complex I inhibition is sufficient to inhibit in situ the activity of endogenous aconitase.},

We demonstrated that a network representing three-dimensional structural similarities among 5452 compounds can be used to automatically group together drugs with similar scaffolds, physicochemical parameters and mode-of-action. We compared the structural network to a network representing transcriptional similarities among a subset of 1309 drugs for which transcriptional response were available in the Connectivity Map data set. Analysis of structurally similar, but transcriptionally different drugs sharing the same MOA enabled us to detect and remove weak and noisy transcriptional responses, greatly enhancing the reliability of transcription-based approaches to drug discovery and drug repositioning. Cardiac glycosides exhibited the strongest transcriptional responses with a significant induction of pathways related to epigenetic regulation, which suggests an epigenetic mechanism of action for these drugs. Drug classes with the weakest transcriptional responses tended to induce expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, hinting at drug-induced drug resistance. Analysis of transcriptionally similar, but structurally different drugs with unrelated MOA, led us to the identification of a 'toxic' transcriptional signature indicative of lysosomal stress (lysosomotropism) and lipid accumulation (phospholipidosis) partially masking the target-specific transcriptional effects of these drugs. We found that this transcriptional signature is shared by 258 compounds and it is associated to the activation of the transcription factor TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. Finally, we built a predictive Random Forest model of these 258 compounds based on 128 physicochemical parameters, which should help in the early identification of potentially toxic drug candidates.},

  abstract = {Most insecticides are insect neurotoxins. Evidence is emerging that sublethal doses of these neurotoxins are affecting the learning and memory of both wild and managed bee colonies, exacerbating the negative effects of pesticide exposure and reducing individual foraging efficiency.Variation in methodologies and interpretation of results across studies has precluded the quantitative evaluation of these impacts that is needed to make recommendations for policy change. It is not clear whether robust effects occur under acute exposure regimes (often argued to be more field‐realistic than the chronic regimes upon which many studies are based), for field‐realistic dosages, and for pesticides other than neonicotinoids.Here we use meta‐analysis to examine the impact of pesticides on bee performance in proboscis extension‐based learning assays, the paradigm most commonly used to assess learning and memory in bees. We draw together 104 (learning) and 167 (memory) estimated effect sizes across a diverse range of studies.We detected significant negative effects of pesticides on learning and memory (i) at field realistic dosages, (ii) under both chronic and acute application, and (iii) for both neonicotinoid and non‐neonicotinoid pesticides groups.We also expose key gaps in the literature that include a critical lack of studies on non‐Apis bees, on larval exposure (potentially one of the major exposure routes), and on performance in alternative learning paradigms. Policy implications. Procedures for the registration of new pesticides within EU member states now typically require assessment of risks to pollinators if potential target crops are attractive to bees. However, our results provide robust quantitative evidence for subtle, sublethal effects, the consequences of which are unlikely to be detected within small‐scale prelicensing laboratory or field trials, but can be critical when pesticides are used at a landscape scale. Our findings highlight the need for long‐term postlicensing environmental safety monitoring as a requirement within licensing policy for plant protection products.},

  abstract = {Sulfoxaflor is a globally important novel insecticide that can have negative impacts on the reproductive output of bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies. However, it remains unclear as to which life-history stage is critically affected by exposure. One hypothesis is that sulfoxaflor exposure early in the colony's life cycle can impair larval development, reducing the number of workers produced and ultimately lowering colony reproductive output. Here we assess the influence of sulfoxaflor exposure on bumblebee larval mortality and growth both when tested in insolation and when in combination with the common fungal parasite Nosema bombi, following a pre-registered design. We found no significant impact of sulfoxaflor (5 ppb) or N. bombi exposure (50 000 spores) on larval mortality when tested in isolation but found an additive, negative effect when larvae received both stressors in combination. Individually, sulfoxaflor and N. bombi exposure each impaired larval growth, although the impact of combined exposure fell significantly short of the predicted sum of the individual effects (i.e. they interacted antagonistically). Ultimately, our results suggest that colony-level consequences of sulfoxaflor exposure for bumblebees may be mediated through direct effects on larvae. As sulfoxaflor is licensed for use globally, our findings highlight the need to understand how novel insecticides impact non-target insects at various stages of their development.},

Exposure at 5 ppb has been previously shown to negatively impact colony reproductive success. Our results showed that sulfoxaflor exposure at 5 ppb (lowest exposure tested) reduced the number of eggs found within the microcolonies (Hedge's d = −0.37), with exposed microcolonies also less likely to produce larvae (Hedge's d = −0.36).

  abstract = {Systemic insecticides, such as neonicotinoids, are a major contributor towards beneficial insect declines. This has led to bans and restrictions on neonicotinoid use globally, most noticeably in the European Union, where four commonly used neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin and thiacloprid) are banned from outside agricultural use. While this might seem like a victory for conservation, restrictions on neonicotinoid use will only benefit insect populations if newly emerging insecticides do not have similar negative impacts on beneficial insects. Flupyradifurone and sulfoxaflor are two novel insecticides that have been registered for use globally, including within the European Union. These novel insecticides differ in their chemical class, but share the same mode of action as neonicotinoids, raising the question as to whether they have similar sub-lethal impacts on beneficial insects. Here, we conducted a systematic literature search of the potential sub-lethal impacts of these novel insecticides on beneficial insects, quantifying these effects with a meta-analysis. We demonstrate that both flupyradifurone and sulfoxaflor have significant sub-lethal impacts on beneficial insects at field-realistic levels of exposure. These results confirm that bans on neonicotinoid use will only protect beneficial insects if paired with significant changes to the agrochemical regulatory process. A failure to modify the regulatory process will result in a continued decline of beneficial insects and the ecosystem services on which global food production relies.},

  abstract = {In this study, different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on the honey bee response were studied. Honey bees were exposed to different concentrations of imidacloprid during a time period of 40 days. Next to these variables, a laboratory-field comparison was conducted. The influence of the chronic exposure on gene expression levels was determined using an in-house developed microarray targeting different immunity-related and detoxification genes to determine stress-related gene expression changes. Increased levels of the detoxification genes encoding, CYP9Q3 and CYT P450, were detected in imidacloprid-exposed honey bees. The different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on honey bees were confirmed physiologically by decreased hypopharyngeal gland sizes. Honey bees exposed to imidacloprid in laboratory cages showed a general immunosuppression and no detoxification mechanisms were triggered significantly, while honey bees in-field showed a resilient response with an immune stimulation at later time points. However, the treated colonies had a brood and population decline tendency after the first brood cycle in the field. In conclusion, this study highlighted the different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on the honey bee response. These findings warn for possible pitfalls concerning the generalization of results based on specific experiments with short exposure times. The increased levels of CYT P450 and CYP9Q3 combined with an immune response reaction can be used as markers for bees which are exposed to pesticides in the field.},

  abstract = {The Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of 1996 requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency to consider the cumulative effects of exposure to pesticides having a ‘common mechanism of toxicity.’ This paper reviews the information available on the acute neurotoxicity and mechanisms of toxic action of pyrethroid insecticides in mammals from the perspective of the ‘common mechanism’ statute of the FQPA. The principal effects of pyrethroids as a class are various signs of excitatory neurotoxicity. Historically, pyrethroids were grouped into two subclasses (Types I and II) based on chemical structure and the production of either the T (tremor) or CS (choreoathetosis with salivation) intoxication syndrome following intravenous or intracerebral administration to rodents. Although this classification system is widely employed, it has several shortcomings for the identification of common toxic effects. In particular, it does not reflect the diversity of intoxication signs found following oral administration of various pyrethroids. Pyrethroids act in vitro on a variety of putative biochemical and physiological target sites, four of which merit consideration as sites of toxic action. Voltage-sensitive sodium channels, the sites of insecticidal action, are also important target sites in mammals. Unlike insects, mammals have multiple sodium channel isoforms that vary in their biophysical and pharmacological properties, including their differential sensitivity to pyrethroids. Pyrethroids also act on some isoforms of voltage-sensitive calcium and chloride channels, and these effects may contribute to the toxicity of some compounds. Effects on peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors are unlikely to be a principal cause of pyrethroid intoxication but may contribute to or enhance convulsions caused by actions at other target sites. In contrast, other putative target sites that have been identified in vitro do not appear to play a major role in pyrethroid intoxication. The diverse toxic actions and pharmacological effects of pyrethroids suggest that simple additivity models based on combined actions at a single target are not appropriate to assess the risks of cumulative exposure to multiple pyrethroids.},

  abstract = {Insect pollinators are essential for both the production of a large proportion of world crops and the health of natural ecosystems. As important pollinators, bumblebees must learn to forage on flowers to feed both themselves and provision their colonies. Increased use of pesticides has caused concern over sublethal effects on bees, such as impacts on reproduction or learning ability. However, little is known about how sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide might affect the ability of bees to visit and manipulate flowers. We observed the behaviour of individual bumblebees from colonies chronically exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide (10 ppb thiamethoxam) or control solutions foraging for the first time on an array of morphologically complex wildflowers (Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens) in an outdoor flight arena. We found that more bees released from pesticide-treated colonies became foragers, and that they visited more L. corniculatus flowers than controls. Interestingly, bees exposed to pesticide collected pollen more often than controls, but control bees learnt to handle flowers efficiently after fewer learning visits than bees exposed to pesticide. There were also different initial floral preferences of our treatment groups; control bees visited a higher proportion of T. repens flowers, and bees exposed to pesticide were more likely to choose L. corniculatus on their first visit. Our results suggest that the foraging behaviour of bumblebees on real flowers can be altered by sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide. This has implications for the foraging success and persistence of bumblebee colonies, but perhaps more importantly for the interactions between wild plants and flower-visiting insects and ability of bees to deliver the crucial pollination services to plants necessary for ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {Neonicotinoid pesticides are used in agriculture to reduce damage from crop pests. However, beneficial insects such as bees can come into contact with these pesticides when foraging in treated areas, with potential consequences for bee declines and pollination service delivery. Honeybees are typically used as a model organism to investigate insecticide impacts on bees, but relatively little is known about impacts on other taxa such as bumblebees. In this experiment, we chronically exposed whole mature bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (2.4ppb \& 10ppb) over four weeks, and compared colony growth under laboratory conditions. We found no impact of insecticide exposure on colony weight gain, or the number or mass of sexuals produced, although colonies exposed to 2.4ppb produced larger males. As previous studies have reported pesticide effects on bumblebee colony growth, this may suggest that impacts on bumblebee colonies are more pronounced for colonies at an earlier stage in the reproductive cycle. Alternatively, it may also indicate that thiamethoxam differs in toxicity compared to previously tested neonicotinoids in terms of reproductive effects. In either case, assessing bumblebee colony development under field conditions is likely more informative for real world scenarios than tests conducted in laboratory conditions.},

  abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated colony-level sublethal effects of imidacloprid on bumble bees, affecting foraging and food consumption, and thus colony growth and reproduction, at lower pesticide concentrations than for honey bee colonies. However, these studies may not reflect the full effects of neonicotinoids on bumble bees because bumble bee life cycles are different from those of honey bees. Unlike honey bees, bumble bees live in colonies for only a few months each year. Assessing the sublethal effects of systemic insecticides only on the colony level is appropriate for honey bees, but for bumble bees, this approach addresses just part of their annual life cycle. Queens are solitary from the time they leave their home colonies in fall until they produce their first workers the following year. Queens forage for pollen and nectar, and are thus exposed to more risk of direct pesticide exposure than honey bee queens. Almost no research has been done on pesticide exposure to and effects on bumble bee queens. Additional research should focus on critical periods in a bumble bee queen’s life which have the greatest nutritional demands, foraging requirements, and potential for exposure to pesticides, particularly the period during and after nest establishment in the spring when the queen must forage for the nutritional needs of her brood and for her own needs while she maintains an elevated body temperature in order to incubate the brood.},

  abstract = {Pollinators underpin global food production, but they are suffering significant declines across the world. Pesticides are thought to be important drivers of these declines. Herbicides are the most widely applied type of pesticides and are broadly considered ‘bee safe’ by regulatory bodies who explicitly allow their application directly onto foraging bees. We aimed to test the mortality effects of spraying the world's most popular herbicide brand (Roundup®) directly onto bumble bees Bombus terrestris audax. We used three Roundup® products, the consumer products Roundup® Ready-To-Use and Roundup® No Glyphosate, the agricultural product Roundup® ProActive, as well as another herbicide with the same active ingredient (glyphosate), Weedol®. Label recommended pesticide concentrations were applied to the bees using a Roundup® Ready-To-Use spray bottle. Bees exhibited 94\% mortality with Roundup® Ready-To-Use® and 30\% mortality with Roundup® ProActive®, over 24 hr. Weedol® did not cause significant mortality, demonstrating that the active ingredient, glyphosate, is not the cause of the mortality. The 96\% mortality caused by Roundup® No Glyphosate supports this conclusion. Dose-dependent mortality caused by Roundup® Ready-To-Use, further confirms its acute toxicity. Roundup® products caused comprehensive matting of bee body hair, suggesting that surfactants, or other co-formulants in the Roundup® products, may cause death by incapacitating the gas exchange system. These mortality results demonstrate that Roundup® products pose a significant hazard to bees, in both agricultural and urban systems, and that exposure of bees to them should be limited. Synthesis and applications. Surfactants, or other co-formulants, in herbicides and other pesticides may contribute to global bee declines. We recommend that, as a precautionary measure until co-formulant identities are made public, label guidelines for all pesticides be altered to explicitly prohibit application to plants when bees are likely to be foraging on them. As current regulatory topical exposure toxicity testing inadequately assesses toxicity of herbicide products, we call for pesticide companies to release the full list of ingredients for each pesticide formulation, as lack of access to this information hampers research to determine safe exposure levels for beneficial insects in agro-ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The dissipation behaviors of the two enantiomers of the organophosphorus pesticide malathion (MA) in environment samples were elucidated using a normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with a cellulose-tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) (CDMPC) chiral column. A validated chiral residue analysis method in soil and water was established; the average recoveries for the two enantiomers were 88–102\% in soil and 81–99\% in water. Racemic and enantiopure R-(+)- and S-(−)-MA were incubated in five soil and water systems. The results of the degradation of racemate in all of the environment samples showed the inactive S-(−)-enantiomer degraded more rapidly than the active R-(+)-enantiomer, resulting in a relative enrichment of the R-form. Moreover, when the enantiopure S-(−)- and R-(+)-MA were incubated in three well-chosen soil and water samples, respectively, inversion from one enantiomer to another was found, indicating that using the optically pure enantiomer will not help to increase the bioactivity and reduce the environmental pollution.}

  abstract = {Thiamethoxam (TMX), an important insecticide, is hepatotoxic and hepatocarcinogenic in mice but not rats. Studies of Syngenta Central Toxicology Laboratory on species specificity in metabolism established that TMX is a much better substrate for mouse liver microsomal CYPs than the corresponding rat or human enzymes in forming desmethyl-TMX (dm-TMX), which is also hepatotoxic, and clothianidin (CLO), which is not hepatotoxic or hepatocarcinogenic. They proposed that TMX hepatotoxicity/hepatocarcinogencity is due to dm-TMX and a further metabolite desmethyl-CLO (dm-CLO) (structurally analogous to a standard inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) acting synergistically. The present study considers formation of formaldehyde (HCHO) and N-methylol intermediates as an alternative mechanism of TMX hepatotoxicity/hepatocarcinogenicity. Comparison of neonicotinoid metabolism by mouse, rat and human microsomes with NADPH showed two important points. First, TMX and dm-TMX yield more HCHO than any other commercial neonicotinoid. Second, mouse microsomes give much higher conversion than rat or human microsomes. These observations provide an alternative hypothesis of HCHO and N-methylol intermediates from CYP-mediated oxidative oxadiazinane ring cleavage as the bioactivated hepatotoxicants. However, the proposed mono-N-methylol CYP metabolites are not observed, possibly further reacting in situ.},

These chemical compounds reach the hive through forager bees, and once there, they can be ingested by the larvae. We evaluated the effects of repeated larval exposure to neonicotinoid insecticide, both in isolation and in combination with strobilurin fungicide, at environmentally relevant doses. The total consumption of the contaminated diet was 23.63\,ng fungicide/larvae (pyraclostrobin) and 0.2364\,ng insecticide/larvae (clothianidin). The effects on post-embryonic development were evaluated over time. Additionally, we assessed the survival pattern of worker bees after emergence, and the pesticides’ effects on the behavior of newly emerged workers and young workers. Young bees that were exposed to the fungicide and those subjected to co-exposure to both pesticides during larval phase showed behavioral changes. The insecticide, both in isolation and in combination with fungicide reduced the bees’ longevity; this effect of larval exposure to pesticides was stronger in bees that were exposed only to the insecticide. Although the larvae did not have sensitivity to exposure to pesticides, they showed later effects after emergence, which may compromise the dynamics of the colony, contributing to the reduction of the populations of bees in agroecosystems.},

  abstract = {The frequent exposure of bees to a wide variety of fungicides, on crops where they forage, can be considered a stressor factor for these pollinators. The organisms are exposed both to the fungicide active ingredients and to the adjuvants of commercial formulations. All these ingredients are brought to the hive by bee foragers through contaminated pollen and nectar, thus exposing also immature individuals during larval phase. This work aimed to compare the effects of larval exposure to the fungicide pyraclostrobin (active ingredient and commercial formulation) and its influence on the cytotoxicity to midguts in adults, which were inoculated with the Nosema ceranae spores in the post-emergence stage. Under laboratory conditions, Apis mellifera larvae received an artificial diet containing fungicide solution from the third to the sixth day of the feeding phase. One-day-old adult workers ingested 100,000 infectious N.~ceranae spores mixed in sucrose solution. Effects on midgut were evaluated through cellular biomarkers of stress and cell death. The exposure to the fungicide (active ingredient and commercial formulation) did not affect the larval post-embryonic development and survival of adult bees. However, this exposure induced cytotoxicity in the cells of the midgut, showed by the increase in DNA fragmentation and alteration in the HSP70 immunolabeling pattern. Without the pathogen, the midgut cytotoxic effects and HSP70 immunolabeling of the organisms exposed to the commercial formulation were lower when compared to the exposure to its active ingredient. However, in the presence of the pathogen, the cytotoxic effects of the commercial formulation to the adult bees’ midgut were potentialized. The pathogen N.~ceranae increased the damage to the intestinal epithelium of adult bees. Thus, realistic doses of pyraclostrobin present in beebread consumed by larvae can affect the health and induce physiological implications to the midgut functions of the adult bees.},

The worldwide used neonicotinoid insecticides and their components can reach surface waters, due to their physico-chemical properties (e.g. water solubility) or improper application in chemical plant protection technology, and can adversely affect non-target aquatic organisms. Formulated pesticides were analysed for alkane sulphonate surfactants by using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. In acute immobilisation tests on Daphnia magna, differences were found among the toxicity of the investigated neonicotinoid AIs and formulations. The toxicity of a formulated insecticide (Apache 50 WG®– AI: clothianidin) was found to be 46.5 times more toxic than explained by its AI, probably due to toxic effect of the formulating agents on D. magna. In contrast, two preparations (Calypso 480SC® – AI: thiacloprid, Actara 240 SC®– AI: thiamethoxam) were 2–3 times less toxic than their AIs. Results indicate possible synergistic/antagonistic interaction with the AIs.},

We assumed a hypothetical true concentration-response function, and examined how random fluctuations of responses around the true responses affected the NOEC and ECx values. For assessment of the relative performances of these endpoints, we adopted two criteria: how large uncertainties were allowed for the minimum requirement for safety to be met, and the probability with which the estimated endpoints exceeded the minimum requirement for safety. The results of simulations indicated that, when there were small uncertainties in the data, performance of the NOEC was comparable with or slightly better than the ECx (EC5 and EC10) in providing benchmark concentrations that satisfied the minimum requirement for safety. With larger random variation of data (the coefficient of variation in responses between replicates within treatments or in the control was noticeably larger than 10 percent), the NOEC performed considerably worse than the ECx in terms of the frequency of simulated runs in which the endpoints exceeded the minimum requirement of safety. We conclude that the NOEC is as relevant as the ECx for risk assessment of chemicals under limited situations.},

In the present study, guttation drops of corn plants obtained from commercial seeds coated with thiamethoxam, clothianidin, imidacloprid and fipronil have been analyzed by an optimized fast UHPLC-DAD procedure showing excellent detection limits and accuracy, both adequate for the purpose. The young plants grown both in pots – in greenhouse – and in open field from coated seeds, produced guttation solutions containing high levels of the neonicotinoid insecticides (up to 346 mg L−1 for imidacloprid, 102 mg L−1 for clothianidin and 146 mg L−1 for thiamethoxam). These concentration levels may represent lethal doses for bees that use guttation drops as a source of water. The neonicotinoid concentrations in guttation drops progressively decrease during the first 10–15 days after the emergence of the plant from the soil. Otherwise fipronil, which is a non-systemic phenylpyrazole insecticide, was never detected into guttation drops. Current results confirm that the physiological fluids of the corn plant can effectively transfer neonicotinoid insecticides from the seed onto the surface of the leaves, where guttation drops may expose bees and other insects to elevated doses of neurotoxic insecticides.},

  abstract = {Several investigations have revealed the toxic effects that neonicotinoids can have on Apis mellifera, while few studies have evaluated the impact of these insecticides can have on the larval stage of the honeybee. From the lethal concentration (LC50) of thiamethoxam for the larvae of the Africanized honeybee, we evaluated the sublethal effects of this insecticide on morphology of the brain. After determine the LC50 (14.34ng/μL of diet) of thiamethoxam, larvae were exposed to a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam equivalent to 1.43ng/μL by acute and subchronic exposure. Morphological and immunocytochemistry analysis of the brains of the exposed bees, showed condensed cells and early cell death in the optic lobes. Additional dose-related effects were observed on larval development. Our results show that the sublethal concentrations of thiamethoxam tested are toxic to Africanized honeybees larvae and can modulate the development and consequently could affect the maintenance and survival of the colony. These results represent the first assessment of the effects of thiamethoxam in Africanized honeybee larvae and should contribute to studies on honey bee colony decline.},

Thiamethoxam reduced the survival of larvae and pupae and consequently decreased the percentage of emerging honey bees. Thiamethoxam induced important physiological disturbances. It increased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity at all developmental stages and increased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and carboxylesterase para (CaEp) activities at the pupal stages. For midgut alkaline phosphatase (ALP), no activity was detected in pupae stages, and no effect was observed in larvae and emerging bees. We assume that the effects of thiamethoxam on the survival, emergence and physiology of honey bees may affect the development of the colony. These results showed that attention should be paid to the exposure to pesticides during the developmental stages of the honey bee.

  abstract = {Thiamethoxam (TMX) is a neurotoxic insecticide widely used for insect pest control. TMX and other neonicotinoids are reported to be potential causes of honey bee decline. Due to its systematic action, TMX may be recovered in pollen, bee bread, nectar, and honey, which make bees likely to be exposed to contaminated diet. In this study, we used immunolabeling to demonstrate that sublethal concentrations of TMX decrease the protein levels of synapsin in the mushroom bodies (MBs) and the antennal lobes (ALs) of pupae and newly emerged worker bees that were exposed through the food to TMX during the larval phase. A decrease in the synapsin level was observed in the MBs of pupae previously exposed to 0.001 and 1.44 ng/µL and in newly emerged bees previously exposed to 1.44 ng/µL and no changes were observed in the optical lobes (OLs). In the ALs, the decrease was observed in pupae and newly emerged bees exposed to 1.44 ng/µL. Because the MBs and ALs are brain structures involved in stimuli reception, learning, and memory consolidation and because synapsin is important for the regulation of neurotransmitter release, we hypothesize that exposure to sublethal concentrations of TMX during the larval stage may cause neurophysiological disorders in honey bees.},

  abstract = {The impact of widespread pesticide use in agriculture has been a major concern to the beekeeping industry. Accumulating evidence suggests that pesticides have a negative impact on honey bees. Additionally, honey bees exposed to different stressors, such as parasites and the pathogens they vector, may further affect their health. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined or sole effect of two stressors on developing honey bees under laboratory conditions where larvae were per os treated with realistic field doses of imidacloprid and later infested with Varroa destructor. Here, we present a gene expression profile of 15 immune-related genes in different honey bee development stages (white-eyed pupae, brown-eyed pupae, and emerged honey bees). Our results show that pesticide consumed in the larval stage lead to a decrease in immune response of bees in early development stages (white- and brown-eyed pupae) and later to an increase in honey bee immune response, and thus honey bee health may be challenged. The gene expression patterns of Varroa infested honey bees changed during development with the number of significantly differentially expressed genes increasing from white-eyed pupae to newly emerged honey bees. The effect of both stressors has a significant effect on antimicrobial peptides and genes involved in defense (apidaecin, hymenoptaecin, defensin-1, lysozyme-2, and PPO) in different developmental stages. All tested honey bees exposed to Varroa had significantly elevated DWV loads. Overall, our data showed changes in immune-related gene expression of three honey bee development stages, exposed to each of two stressors alone or combined, which varies depending on the developmental stage.},

  abstract = {Animal-mediated pollination is required for the reproduction of the majority of angiosperms, and pollinators are therefore essential for ecosystem functioning and the economy. Two major threats to insect pollinators are anthropogenic land-use change and the spread of pathogens, whose effects may interact to impact pollination. Here, we investigated the relative effects on the ecosystem service of pollination of (i) land-use change brought on by agriculture and urbanization as well as (ii) the prevalence of pollinator parasites, using experimental insect pollinator-dependent plant species in natural pollinator communities. We found that pollinator habitat (i.e. availability of nesting resources for ground-nesting bees and local flower richness) was strongly related to flower visitation rates at the local scale and indirectly influenced plant pollination success. At the landscape scale, pollination was positively related to urbanization, both directly and indirectly via elevated visitation rates. Bumblebees were the most abundant pollinator group visiting experimental flowers. Prevalence of trypanosomatids, such as the common bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi, was higher in urban compared with agricultural areas, a relationship which was mediated through higher Bombus abundance. Yet, we did not find any top-down, negative effects of bumblebee parasitism on pollination. We conclude that urban areas can be places of high transmission of both pollen and pathogens.},

  abstract = {Pollination is a major ecosystem service in which insects, particularly bees, play an important role for the reproduction of most angiosperms. Currently, this service is considered under threat due to reported bee declines. Moderately urbanised areas could be important for pollinators and pollination; however, compared to agricultural and natural systems, they are poorly studied. Here, we investigated the relative effects of local habitat quality and anthropogenic land use across an agricultural to urban gradient for local plant and flying insect communities. We quantified local flower visitor networks and related network architecture to these local and landscape factors using structural equation modelling. Flower visitor network architecture is often assumed to act as a surrogate for the ecosystem service of pollination. To test this idea, we related network metrics to pollination of four experimental, insect pollinator-dependent plant species. Overall, local land use markedly influenced plant and flying insect communities. Flower richness and bee richness were higher in urban compared to agricultural areas. Flower visitor network metrics (e.g. linkage density) increased with the proportion of urban area surrounding a site. Also, relative to agricultural areas, urban flower visitors were more generalised and foraged from a higher number of plant species, likely a consequence of higher urban flowering plant richness. However, urban bees also visited a lower proportion of the available flowering plants (higher specialisation). Surprisingly, linkage density, network specialisation and flower visitor generality were not related to pollination of our four experimental plants per se. Rather, it was the proportion of urban cover, flying insect abundance and bee richness that were positively related to pollination. Our findings show strong effects of local land use on plant and flying insect communities and flower visitor interaction networks. We observed increased overall visitation rates and pollination services to our experimental plants in urban compared to agricultural areas, despite increased urban flower visitor generality. Indeed, flower visitor network metrics were a poor proxy of provision of the ecosystem service of pollination. Nevertheless, our results point to potential facilitating effects of diverse urban floral and bee communities for pollination. A lay summary is available for this article.},

Yet its impact on ecosystem services is poorly investigated. Here, using a replicated experimental design, we test how Central European cities impact flying insects and the ecosystem service of pollination. City sites have lower insect species richness, particularly of Diptera and Lepidoptera, than neighbouring rural sites. In contrast, Hymenoptera, especially bees, show higher species richness and flower visitation rates in cities, where our experimentally derived measure of pollination is correspondingly higher. As well as revealing facets of biodiversity (e.g. phylogenetic diversity) that correlate well with pollination, we also find that ecotones in insect-friendly green cover surrounding both urban and rural sites boost pollination. Appropriately managed cities could enhance the conservation of Hymenoptera and thereby act as hotspots for pollination services that bees provide to wild flowers and crops grown in urban settings.},

In this study, we characterized and compared AChE catalytic activity, mRNA, protein expression, and protein localization in a variety of neuronal (SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and primary cerebellar granule neurons (CGN)) and non-neuronal (LLC-MK2, HeLa, THP-1, and primary astrocytes) cell types. All cell lines expressed AChE catalytic activity; however the levels of AChE-specific activity were higher in neuronal cells than in the non-neuronal cell types. CGN expressed significantly more AChE activity than SH-SY5Y cells. All cell lines analyzed expressed AChE protein at equivalent levels, as well as mRNA splice variants. Localization of AChE was characterized by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. SH-SY5Y, CGN, and nerve-growth factor-differentiated PC-12 cells exhibited a pattern of AChE localization characterized as diffuse in the cytoplasm and punctate staining along neurites and on the plasma membrane. The localization in HeLa, LLC-MK2, fibroblasts, and undifferentiated PC-12 cells was significantly different than in neuronal cells—AChE was intensely localized in the perinuclear region, without staining near or on the plasma membrane. Based on the evidence presented here, we hypothesize that the presence of AChE protein doesn't correlate with catalytic activity, and the diffuse cytoplasmic and plasma membrane localization of AChE is a property of neuronal cell types. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Pesticides enter the hive through contaminated nectar and pollen carried by returning forager honey bees or placed in the hive by beekeepers when managing hive pests. We used an in~vitro rearing method to characterize the effects of seven pesticides on developing brood subjected dietary exposure at worse-case environmental concentrations detected in wax and pollen. The pesticides tested included acaricides (amitraz, coumaphos, fluvalinate), insecticides (chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid), one fungicide (chlorothalonil), and one herbicide (glyphosate). The larvae were exposed chronically for six days of mimicking exposure during the entire larval feeding period, which is the worst possible scenario of larval exposure. Survival, duration of immature development, the weight of newly emerged adult, morphologies of the antenna and the hypopharyngeal gland, and gene expression were recorded. Survival of bees exposed to amitraz, coumaphos, fluvalinate, chlorpyrifos, and chlorothalonil was the most sensitive endpoint despite observed changes in many developmental and physiological parameters across the seven pesticides. Our findings suggest that pesticide exposure during larvae development may affect the survival and health of immature honey bees, thus contributing to overall colony stress or loss. Additionally, pesticide exposure altered gene expression of detoxification enzymes. However, the tested exposure scenario is unlikely to be representative of real-world conditions but emphasizes the importance of proper hive management to minimize pesticide contamination of the hive environment or simulates a future scenario of increased contamination.},

  abstract = {The neurological effects of organophosphate pesticides, commonly used on foods and in households, are an important public health concern. Furthermore, subclinical exposure to combinations of organophosphates is implicated in Gulf War illness. Here we characterized the effects of the broadly-used insecticide chlorpyrifos on dopamine and glutamatergic neurotransmission effectors in corticostriatal motor/reward circuitry. Chlorpyrifos potentiated PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the striatal protein DARPP-32 and the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors in mouse brain slices. It also increased GluR1 phosphorylation by PKA when administered systemically. This correlated with enhanced glutamate release from cortical projections in rat striatum. Similar effects were induced by the sarin congener, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, alone or in combination with the putative neuroprotectant, pyridostigmine bromide and the pesticide DEET. This combination, meant to mimic the neurotoxicant exposure encountered by veterans of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, also induced hyperphosphorylation of the neurofibrillary tangle-associated protein tau. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate and pyrodostigmine bromide, alone or in combination, also increased the aberrant activity of the protein kinase, Cdk5, as indicated by conversion of its activating cofactor p35 to p25. Thus consistent with recent findings in humans and animals, organophosphate exposure causes dysregulation in the motor/reward circuitry and invokes mechanisms associated with neurological disorders and neurodegeneration.},

  abstract = {The honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) is an important pollinator and a model for pesticide effects on insect pollinators. The effects of agricultural pesticides on honeybee health have therefore raised concern. Bees can be exposed to multiple pesticides that may interact synergistically, amplifying their side effects. Attention has focused on neonicotinoid pesticides, but flupyradifurone (FPF) is a novel butenolide insecticide that is also systemic and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. We therefore tested the lethal and sublethal toxic effects of FPF over different seasons and worker types, and the interaction of FPF with a common SBI fungicide, propiconazole. We provide the first demonstration of adverse synergistic effects on bee survival and behaviour (poor coordination, hyperactivity, apathy) even at FPF field-realistic doses (worst-case scenarios). Pesticide effects were significantly influenced by worker type and season. Foragers were consistently more susceptible to the pesticides (4-fold greater effect) than in-hive bees, and both worker types were more strongly affected by FPF in summer as compared with spring. Because risk assessment (RA) requires relatively limited tests that only marginally address bee behaviour and do not consider the influence of bee age and season, our results raise concerns about the safety of approved pesticides, including FPF. We suggest that pesticide RA also test for common chemical mixture synergies on behaviour and survival.},

  abstract = {The assessment of pesticide risks to insect pollinators have typically focused on short-term, lethal impacts. The environmental ramifications of many of the world’s most commonly employed pesticides, such as those exhibiting systemic properties that can result in long-lasting exposure to insects, may thus be severely underestimated. Here, seven laboratories from Europe and North America performed a standardised experiment (a ring-test) to study the long-term lethal and sublethal impacts of the relatively recently approved ‘bee safe’ butenolide pesticide flupyradifurone (FPF, active ingredient in Sivanto®) on honey bees. The emerging contaminant, FPF, impaired bee survival and behaviour at field-realistic doses (down to 11\,ng/bee/day, corresponding to 400\,µg/kg) that were up to 101-fold lower than those reported by risk assessments (1110\,ng/bee/day), despite an absence of time-reinforced toxicity. Our findings raise concerns about the chronic impact of pesticides on pollinators at a global scale and support a novel methodology for a refined risk assessment.},

This simple method is highly sensitive, provides quantifiable data and offers high-throughput screening capability. Starting with the treatment of cells with different doses of damaging agents, pre-prepared growing media containing 96-well plates are inoculated and cell population is automatically monitored every 10 min for 48 hours.

  abstract = {Neonicotinoids, sometimes called ‘neonics’, are a class of insecticides targeting neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which belong to the family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) or Cys-loop receptors. The widespread application of these neurotoxic insecticides in agriculture is tied to the worldwide decline of bee populations, due to their sublethal effects on bee memory, behavior and reproduction. In 2018, the member states of the European Union, agreed on a ban of most neonicotinoids, with exemption for greenhouses. However, a new generation of sulfoximine-based insecticides, such as sulfoxaflor, has recently been introduced to the agricultural market claiming they are chemically distinct from neonicotinoids. Using the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) as a well-established tool for structural studies of nicotinic receptors, we engineered AChBP variants that reliably mimic the neurotransmitter binding site of honeybee nicotinic receptors. Three-dimensional structures of sulfoxaflor-bound receptors reveal, despite the distinct chemistry claim, that the molecule is recognized through receptor interactions that are virtually identical to neonicotinoids. This observation suggests that sulfoximine- and neonicotinoid-type insecticides share a common mode of action, and that the legislative ban on certain insecticides should, as a precaution, be expanded based on pharmacological activity at their target receptors rather than on chemical composition. Crystal structure of an insect nicotinic receptor mimic (iAChBP) in complex with the insecticide sulfoxaflor. This abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2019 Meeting.

Although various experimental data have provided evidence that pesticides can possess genotoxic properties in animals and in in vitro test systems after acute and chronic exposure, the information on the genotoxic effects of some of pesticides is limited and inconsistent. In the present study, the genotoxic potential of commonly used pesticides (i.e., dimethoate and methyl parathion from the organophosphate class, propoxur and pirimicarb from carbamates, and cypermethrin and permethrin from pyrethroids) have been evaluated. The genotoxic effects of these substances were examined using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay in freshly isolated human peripheral lymphocytes. The cells were incubated with 10, 50, 100 and 200 µg/ml concentrations of the test substances for 0.5 h at 37°C and DNA damage was compared with that obtained in lymphocytes from the same donor not treated with substances. Hydrogen peroxide, 100 µM, was used as a positive control. Within the concentration ranges studied, no significant cytotoxic effects were observed. Dimethoate and methyl parathion at 100 and 200 µg/ml; propoxur at 50, 100 and 200 µg/ml, and pirimicarb, cypermethrin and permethrin at 200 µg/ml significantly increased DNA damage in human lymphocytes.},

  abstract = {Risk assessment studies addressing effects of agrochemicals on bumblebees frequently use microcolonies. These are queenless colonies consisting of workers only in which typically one worker will lay unfertilized male-destined eggs. In the first tier of risk assessment for bees, short-term laboratory experiments (e.g. microcolonies) are used, the results of which will determine whether higher tier (semi-)field experiments are needed. To evaluate the suitability of microcolonies for risk assessment, a direct comparison between different assessment methods for the neonicotinoid pesticides acetamiprid and thiacloprid was made: microcolonies and queenright colonies under short-term laboratory conditions, queenright colonies under long-term laboratory conditions, and queenright colonies under field conditions. Here, we demonstrate that results from microcolonies contradict results from queenright colonies. While thiacloprid negatively impacted gyne production in queenright colonies, it had a positive effect on microcolony size. By contrast, thiacloprid had no significant effect on fitness parameters of queenright colonies under short-term laboratory conditions when mostly workers are produced. These results thus highlight both the need for long term assessments, allowing evaluation of gyne production, and the risk of reaching erroneous conclusions when using microcolonies. The negative effect of thiacloprid on colony fitness was confirmed under field conditions, where thiacloprid affected the production of reproductives, colony weight gain, worker weight, and foraging behaviour. For acetamiprid, a negative trend on colony fitness could only be shown in a field setup. Therefore, field-realistic setups, which allow colonies to forage freely, are most appropriate to assess sublethal effects of pesticides affecting behaviour and learning.},

Actually, GLY has been detected in honey and bee pollen baskets. However, its impact on the honey bee brood is poorly explored. Therefore, we assessed the effects of GLY on larval development under chronic exposure during in vitro rearing. Even though this procedure does not account for social compensatory mechanisms such as brood care by adult workers, it allows us to control the herbicide dose, homogenize nutrition and minimize environmental stress. Our results show that brood fed with food containing GLY traces (1.25–5.0 mg per litre of food) had a higher proportion of larvae with delayed moulting and reduced weight. Our assessment also indicates a non-monotonic dose-response and variability in the effects among colonies. Differences in genetic diversity could explain the variation in susceptibility to GLY. Accordingly, the transcription of immune/detoxifying genes in the guts of larvae exposed to GLY was variably regulated among the colonies studied. Consequently, under laboratory conditions, the response of honey bees to GLY indicates that it is a stressor that affects larval development depending on individual and colony susceptibility.},

In laboratory assessments, GLY affects the honey bee larval development by delaying its moulting, among other negative effects. However, it is still unknown how GLY affects larval physiology when there are no observable signs of toxicity. We carried out a longitudinal experimental design using the in~vitro rearing procedure. Larvae were fed with food containing or not a sub-lethal dose of GLY in chronic exposure (120~h). Individuals without observable signs of toxicity were sampled and their gene expression profile was analyzed with a transcriptomic approach to compare between treatments. Even though 29\% of larvae were asymptomatic in the exposed group, they showed transcriptional changes in several genes after the GLY chronic intake. A total of 19 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed in the RNA-Seq experiment, mainly linked with defensive response and intermediary metabolism processes. Furthermore, the enriched functional categories in the transcriptome of the exposed asymptomatic larvae were linked with enzymes with catalytic and redox activity. Our results suggest an enhanced catabolism and oxidative metabolism in honey bee larvae as a consequence of the sub-lethal exposure to GLY, even in the absence of observable symptoms.},

The use of thiacloprid is increasingly widespread worldwide, therefore is very important the assessment of its possible genotoxic and cytotoxic effects on a living organism. That is the reason why we studied the thiacloprid influence on the structure and stability of DNA in presented work. We have been studied the thiacloprid interaction with calf thymus DNA. Association constant was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy using equilibrium receptor-ligand binding analysis. The thermal denaturation of DNA was used to identify the mode of interaction. Viscosity changes were recorded to confirm/disconfirm the intercalation mode of interaction. Given the results, we can conclude that neonicotinoid pesticide thiacloprid destabilizes DNA. It changes the structure and stability of DNA through binding into the minor groove by hydrophobic or hydrogen interactions.},

Thermodynamic parameters such as QT (J~g−1 soil), ∆Hmet (kJ~mol−1), JQ/S (J~g−1~h−1), k (h−1), and soil enzymatic activities, dehydrogenase, phosphomonoesterase, arginine deaminase, and urease, were used to evaluate whole metabolic activity changes and acute toxicity following IMI and ACE treatment. Various profiles of thermogenic curves reflect different soil microbial activities. The microbial growth rate constant k, total heat evolution QT (expect for IMI), and inhibitory ratio I show linear relationship with the doses of IMI and ACE. QT for IMI increases at 0.0–20~μg~g−1 and then decreases at 20–80~μg~g−1, possibly attributing to the presence of tolerant microorganisms. The 50~\% inhibitory ratios (IC50) of IMI and ACE are 95.7 and 77.2~μg~g−1, respectively. ACE displays slightly higher toxicity than IMI. Plots of k and QT against microbial biomass-C indicate that the k and QT are growth yield-dependent. IMI and ACE show 29.6; 40.4 and 23.0; and 23.3, 21.7, and 30.5~\% inhibition of dehydrogenase, phosphomonoesterase, and urease activity, respectively. By contrast, the arginine deaminase activity is enhanced by 15.2 and 13.2~\% with IMI and ACE, respectively. The parametric indices selected give a quantitative dose-response relationship of both insecticides and indicate that ACE is more toxic than IMI due to their difference in molecular structures.},

  abstract = {Thousands of tons of neonicotinoids are widely used around the world as broad-spectrum systemic insecticides and veterinary drugs. Researchers originally thought that neonicotinoids exhibited low mammalian toxicity. However, following their widespread use, it became increasingly evident that neonicotinoids could have various toxic effects on vertebrates and invertebrates. The primary focus of this review is to summarize the research progress associated with oxidative stress as a plausible mechanism for neonicotinoid-induced toxicity as well as neonicotinoid metabolism. This review summarizes the research conducted over the past decade into the production of reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, and oxidative stress as aresult of neonicotinoid treatments, along with their correlation with the toxicity and metabolism of neonicotinoids. The metabolism of neonicotinoids and protection of various compounds against neonicotinoid-induced toxicity based on their antioxidative effects is also discussed. This review sheds new light on the critical roles of oxidative stress in neonicotinoid-induced toxicity to nontarget species.},

  abstract = {There are increasing concerns regarding the impact of agrochemical pesticides on non-target organisms. Prior efforts indicated that pesticides could cause honeybee abnormal development in response to neurotoxins such as neonicotinoid. Here, we examined the influence of carbendazim, a widespread fungicide, on honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) brain development. Changes in global gene expression in the brains of newly emerged adult honeybees after carbendazim exposure during the larval stage, obtained from large-scale transcriptome approaches, revealed the molecular mechanisms responding to this fungicide in the honeybee brain. To further understand the effects of carbendazim on the health of honeybees, the functions of differentially expressed genes were assessed and compared. We found that neuroregulatory genes were repressed after carbendazim exposure, which at least partially accounts for the neurotoxic effects of this fungicide on honeybees. Moreover, carbendazim exposure also altered the expression of metabolism, transport, sensor, and hormone related genes. Notably, larvae in the carbendazim-treated group needed more time to shift into the dormant pupal state than larvae in the non-treated group. Accordingly, they possessed a low juvenile hormone and high ecdysone titers compared with control group, respectively. To our knowledge, the present study is the first reporting carbendazim neurotoxic effects, and that its sublethal effects may disturb honeybee development and weaken honeybee colonies.},

Here we report an analysis of the co-evolution of translatomes and transcriptomes using ribosome-profiling and matched RNA-sequencing data for three organs (brain, liver and testis) in five mammals (human, macaque, mouse, opossum and platypus) and a bird (chicken). Our within-species analyses reveal that translational regulation is widespread in the different organs, in particular across the spermatogenic cell types of the testis. The between-species divergence in gene expression is around 20\% lower at the translatome layer than at the transcriptome layer owing to extensive buffering between the expression layers, which especially preserved old, essential and housekeeping genes. Translational upregulation specifically counterbalanced global dosage reductions during the evolution of sex chromosomes and the effects of meiotic sex-chromosome inactivation during spermatogenesis. Despite the overall prevalence of buffering, some genes evolved faster at the translatome layer—potentially indicating adaptive changes in expression; testis tissue shows the highest fraction of such genes. Further analyses incorporating mass spectrometry proteomics data establish that the co-evolution of transcriptomes and translatomes is reflected at the proteome layer. Together, our work uncovers co-evolutionary patterns and associated selective forces across the expression layers, and provides a resource for understanding their interplay in mammalian organs.},

Carbendazim is a widely used broad-spectrum fungicide that inhibits mitotic microtubule formation and cell division. However, the impact of carbendazim on bee health and development has not been fully elucidated. Here, using proteomics approaches, we assessed in~vitro the changes in the expression of functional proteins in the head of newly emerged adults following treatment with field concentration of carbendazim during the larval stage. Treatment with carbendazim severely altered 266 protein expression patterns in the heads of adults and 218 of them showed downregulation after carbendazim exposure. Notably, major royal jelly proteins, a crucial multifunctional protein family with irreplaceable function in sustaining the development of colonies, were significantly suppressed in carbendazim-treated bees. This result was verified in both head and hypopharyngeal gland of nurse bees. Moreover, visual and olfactory loss, immune functions, muscular activity, social behavior, neural and brain development, protein synthesis and modification, and metabolism-related proteins were likely inhibited by carbendazim treatment. Together, these results suggest that carbendazim is an environmental risk factor that likely weakens bee colonies, partially due to reduced expression of major royal jelly proteins, which may be potential causes of colony collapse disorder.},

  abstract = {Recent reports indicate that organophosphate insecticides, in addition to inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity, can bind directly at a subset of muscarinic receptors, which also bind cis-methyldioxolane with high affinity. Muscarinic receptors are known to act through at least two second messenger systems, either the stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover (mediated through the M1 and M3 receptor subtypes) or the inhibition of cAMP formation (mediated through the M2 and M4 receptor subtypes). We have investigated the action of the active forms of parathion, malathion, and chlorpyrifos (paraoxon, malaoxon, and chlorpyrifos oxon, respectively) on these second messenger systems in cortical slices from adult male Long-Evans rats. Paraoxon, malaoxon, and chlorpyrifos oxon (10−8 to 10−4 M) inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect on cAMP formation was blocked by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10 μM). These results suggest that paraoxon, malaoxon, and chlorpyrifos oxon can act as agonists at the M2 and/or M4 subset of muscarinic receptors. In addition, chlorpyrifos may have another site of action. In contrast, none of the organophosphates had any effect on basal or carbachol-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The differential activity on these two second messenger systems make it unlikely that the observed effects on cAMP formation are due to increases in endogenous acetylcholine resulting from inhibition of acetylcholinesterase.},

The major dose-limiting factor is nephrotoxicity, in particular in the proximal tubule. Here, we use an integrated omics approach, including transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics coupled to biokinetics to identify cell stress response pathways induced by cisplatin. The human renal proximal tubular cell line RPTEC/TERT1 was treated with sub-cytotoxic concentrations of cisplatin (0.5 and 2 μM) in a daily repeat dose treating regime for up to 14 days. Biokinetic analysis showed that cisplatin was taken up from the basolateral compartment, transported to the apical compartment, and accumulated in cells over time. This is in line with basolateral uptake of cisplatin via organic cation transporter 2 and bioactivation via gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase located on the apical side of proximal tubular cells. Cisplatin affected several pathways including, p53 signalling, Nrf2 mediated oxidative stress response, mitochondrial processes, mTOR and AMPK signalling. In addition, we identified novel pathways changed by cisplatin, including eIF2 signalling, actin nucleation via the ARP/WASP complex and regulation of cell polarization. In conclusion, using an integrated omic approach together with biokinetics we have identified both novel and established mechanisms of cisplatin toxicity.},

  abstract = {Little is known about the likelihood of occurrence of guttation fluids in sugar beet, and the extent to which its occurrence is related to weather conditions. There is also uncertainty regarding the extent to which the concentration of neonicotinoid residues in guttation fluid of seed treated sugar beet represents an environmentally relevant route of exposure for honey bees. In our study in 2009 and 2010, guttation monitoring, sampling and analysis of neonicotinoid residues in guttation fluids were conducted on 31 field sites consisting of differing landscapes with frequent cultivation of sugar beet. High concentrations of neonicotinoids in the guttation fluid up to 9~mg clothianidin L−1 were recorded, levels that would result in lethal effects to honey bees consuming such droplets. However, we demonstrated that the occurrence of guttation in sugar beet was very rare especially compared to the occurrence of guttation in the vegetation adjacent to sugar beet fields or the occurrence of dew. Therefore, we concluded that guttation fluids from seed treated sugar beet might not be a preferred water source for water foraging bees. Thus, an exposure of honey bee colonies to neonicotinoids dissolved in guttation fluids of seed treated sugar beet is very unlikely.},

In addition, in vitro band shift assays demonstrate that a GST-Pdr1 fusion protein can bind to the PDREs of PDR10 and PDR15. DNase I footprinting allowed the identification of the precise PDRE binding motifs, indicating the presence of a novel slightly degenerate PDRE motif in the PDR15 promoter. Finally, PDR10 and PDR15 mRNA levels vary dramatically in abundance in isogenic yeast strains carrying either Δpdr1, Δpdr3 and Δpdr1 Δpdr3 deletions or pdr1-3 and pdr3-2 gain-of-function mutations, demonstrating that both PDR10 and PDR15 are new members of the yeast PDR network.},

  abstract = {Wild bee declines have been ascribed in part to neonicotinoid insecticides. While short-term laboratory studies on commercially bred species (principally honeybees and bumblebees) have identified sub-lethal effects, there is no strong evidence linking these insecticides to losses of the majority of wild bee species. We relate 18 years of UK national wild bee distribution data for 62 species to amounts of neonicotinoid use in oilseed rape. Using a multi-species dynamic Bayesian occupancy analysis, we find evidence of increased population extinction rates in response to neonicotinoid seed treatment use on oilseed rape. Species foraging on oilseed rape benefit from the cover of this crop, but were on average three times more negatively affected by exposure to neonicotinoids than non-crop foragers. Our results suggest that sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids could scale up to cause losses of bee biodiversity. Restrictions on neonicotinoid use may reduce population declines.},

  abstract = {Damage confirmed Early studies of the impacts of neonicotinoid insecticides on insect pollinators indicated considerable harm. However, lingering criticism was that the studies did not represent field-realistic levels of the chemicals or prevailing environmental conditions. Two studies, conducted on different crops and on two continents, now substantiate that neonicotinoids diminish bee health (see the Perspective by Kerr). Tsvetkov et al. find that bees near corn crops are exposed to neonicotinoids for 3 to 4 months via nontarget pollen, resulting in decreased survival and immune responses, especially when coexposed to a commonly used agrochemical fungicide. Woodcock et al., in a multicounty experiment on rapeseed in Europe, find that neonicotinoid exposure from several nontarget sources reduces overwintering success and colony reproduction in both honeybees and wild bees. These field results confirm that neonicotinoids negatively affect pollinator health under realistic agricultural conditions. Science, this issue p. 1395, p. 1393; see also p. 1331 Neonicotinoid seed dressings have caused concern world-wide. We use large field experiments to assess the effects of neonicotinoid-treated crops on three bee species across three countries (Hungary, Germany, and the United Kingdom). Winter-sown oilseed rape was grown commercially with either seed coatings containing neonicotinoids (clothianidin or thiamethoxam) or no seed treatment (control). For honey bees, we found both negative (Hungary and United Kingdom) and positive (Germany) effects during crop flowering. In Hungary, negative effects on honey bees (associated with clothianidin) persisted over winter and resulted in smaller colonies in the following spring (24\% declines). In wild bees (Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis), reproduction was negatively correlated with neonicotinoid residues. These findings point to neonicotinoids causing a reduced capacity of bee species to establish new populations in the year following exposure. Bee health is affected by neonicotinoids under field-realistic conditions across crops conditions. Bee health is affected by neonicotinoids under field-realistic conditions across crops conditions.},

  abstract = {Neonicotinoids are highly toxic to insects and may systemically translocate to nectar and pollen of plants where foraging bees may become exposed. Exposure to neonicotinoids can induce detrimental sublethal effects on individual and colonies of bees and may have long-term impacts, such as impaired foraging, reduced longevity, and reduced brood care or production. Less well-studied are the potential effects on queen bumble bees that may become exposed while foraging in the spring during colony initiation. This study assessed queen survival and nest founding in caged bumble bees [Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae)] after chronic (18-d) dietary exposure of imidacloprid in syrup (1, 5, 10, and 25 ppb) and pollen (0.3, 1.7, 3.3, and 8.3 ppb), paired respectively. Here we show some mortality in queens exposed at all doses even as low as 1 ppb, and, compared with untreated queens, significantly reduced survival of treated queens at the two highest doses. Queens that survived initial imidacloprid exposure commenced nest initiation; however, they exhibited dose-dependent delay in egg-laying and emergence of worker brood. Furthermore, imidacloprid treatment affected other parameters such as nest and queen weight. This study is the first to show direct impacts of imidacloprid at field-relevant levels on individual B. impatiens queen survival and nest founding, indicating that bumble bee queens are particularly sensitive to neonicotinoids when directly exposed. This study also helps focus pesticide risk mitigation efforts and highlights the importance of reducing exposure rates in the early spring when bumble bee queens, and other wild bees are foraging and initiating nests.},

  abstract = {Background Numerous surveys reveal high levels of pesticide residue contamination in honey bee comb. We conducted studies to examine possible direct and indirect effects of pesticide exposure from contaminated brood comb on developing worker bees and adult worker lifespan. Methodology/Principal Findings Worker bees were reared in brood comb containing high levels of known pesticide residues (treatment) or in relatively uncontaminated brood comb (control). Delayed development was observed in bees reared in treatment combs containing high levels of pesticides particularly in the early stages (day 4 and 8) of worker bee development. Adult longevity was reduced by 4 days in bees exposed to pesticide residues in contaminated brood comb during development. Pesticide residue migration from comb containing high pesticide residues caused contamination of control comb after multiple brood cycles and provided insight on how quickly residues move through wax. Higher brood mortality and delayed adult emergence occurred after multiple brood cycles in contaminated control combs. In contrast, survivability increased in bees reared in treatment comb after multiple brood cycles when pesticide residues had been reduced in treatment combs due to residue migration into uncontaminated control combs, supporting comb replacement efforts. Chemical analysis after the experiment confirmed the migration of pesticide residues from treatment combs into previously uncontaminated control comb. Conclusions/Significance This study is the first to demonstrate sub-lethal effects on worker honey bees from pesticide residue exposure from contaminated brood comb. Sub-lethal effects, including delayed larval development and adult emergence or shortened adult longevity, can have indirect effects on the colony such as premature shifts in hive roles and foraging activity. In addition, longer development time for bees may provide a reproductive advantage for parasitic Varroa destructor mites. The impact of delayed development in bees on Varroa mite fecundity should be examined further.},

Previous studies have demonstrated that this phenomenon originates from abnormal neural development in response to imidacloprid exposure. Here, we further investigated the global gene expression changes in the heads of newly emerged adults and observed that 578 genes showed more than 2-fold changes in gene expression after imidacloprid exposure. This information might aid in understanding the effects of pesticides on the health of pollinators. For example, the genes encoding major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs), a group of multifunctional proteins with significant roles in the sustainable development of bee colonies, were strongly downregulated. These downregulation patterns were further confirmed through analyses using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on the heads of 6-day-old nurse bees. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that sublethal doses of imidacloprid affect mrjp expression and likely weaken bee colonies.},

We tested if the consumption of nectar (sucrose solution) with a field-realistic concentration of 4~ppm flupyradifurone (FPF) could alter foraging behavior and recruitment dancing in Apis mellifera. Foragers were repelled by FPF. They visited the FPF feeder less often and spent less time imbibing sucrose solution (2.5~M, 65\% w/w) with FPF. As a result, bees feeding on the FPF treatment consumed 16\% less nectar. However, FPF did not affect dancing: there were no effects on unloading wait time, the number of dance bouts per nest visit, or the number of dance circuits performed per dance bout. FPF could therefore deter bees from foraging on contaminated nectar. However, the willingness of bees to recruit nestmates for nectar with FPF is concerning. Recruitment can rapidly amplify the number of foragers and could overcome the decrease in consumption of FPF-contaminated nectar, resulting in a net inflow of pesticide to the colony. FPF also significantly altered the expression of 116 genes, some of which may be relevant for the olfactory learning deficits induced by FPF and the toxicity of FPF.},

The silkworm, Bombyx mori, has been domesticated for more than two thousand years and its aces have no history of pesticide exposure. Here, we investigated the functional differences between two ace genes, BmAce1 and BmAce2, in the silkworm. qPCR analysis indicated that BmAce1 is highly expressed in muscle and BmAce2 is more ubiquitously expressed among tissues and enriched in the head. Both genes were separately suppressed using chemically synthesized siRNAs. The mRNA abundance of the two ace genes was significantly reduced to about 13\% – 75\% of the control levels after siRNA injection. The AChE activities were decreased to 32\% to 85\% of control levels. Silencing BmAce2 resulted in about 26\% mortality, faster and higher than the 20\% in the siBmAce1-treated group. Silencing BmAce1 impacted motor control and development to a greater extent than silencing BmAce2, although both treatment groups suffered motor disability, slowed development and reduced cocoons. Both genes have essential, differing biological significance.},

The parasitic mite Varroa destructor, in association with deformed wing virus (DWV), plays a key role in this phenomenon, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. To elucidate these mechanisms, we analyzed the gene expression profile of uninfested and mite infested bees, under laboratory and field conditions, highlighting the effects of parasitization on the bee's transcriptome under a variety of conditions and scenarios. Parasitization was significantly correlated with higher viral loads. Honey bees exposed to mite infestation exhibited an altered expression of genes related to stress response, immunity, nervous system function, metabolism and behavioural maturation. Additionally, mite infested young bees showed a gene expression profile resembling that of forager bees. To identify potential molecular markers of colony decline, the expression of genes that were commonly regulated across the experiments were subsequently assessed in colonies experiencing increasing mite infestation levels. These studies suggest that PGRP-2, hymenoptaecin, a glucan recognition protein, UNC93 and a p450 cytocrome maybe suitable general biomarkers of Varroa-induced colony decline. Furthermore, the reliability of vitellogenin, a yolk protein previously identified as a good marker of colony survival, was confirmed here.},

Although some pesticides elicit a cellular response, which interferes with thyroid hormone signaling, we found no evidence that they can act as receptor agonists or antagonists. We conclude that the nuclear receptors of thyroid hormone are not common targets of THD, and that pesticide neurodevelopmental toxicity is not explained by a general alteration of neural cell response to thyroid hormone.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) plays a key role in terminating neurotransmission at cholinergic synapses. AChE is also found in tissues devoid of cholinergic responses, indicating potential functions beyond neurotransmission. It has been suggested that AChE may participate in development, differentiation, and pathogenic processes such as Alzheimer's disease and tumorigenesis. We examined AChE expression in a number of cell lines upon induction of apoptosis by various stimuli. AChE is induced in all apoptotic cells examined as determined by cytochemical staining, immunological analysis, affinity chromatography purification, and molecular cloning. The AChE protein was found in the cytoplasm at the initiation of apoptosis and then in the nucleus or apoptotic bodies upon commitment to cell death. Sequence analysis revealed that AChE expressed in apoptotic cells is identical to the synapse type AChE. Pharmacological inhibitors of AChE prevented apoptosis. Furthermore, blocking the expression of AChE with antisense inhibited apoptosis. Therefore, our studies demonstrate that AChE is potentially a marker and a regulator of apoptosis.},

  abstract = {Increasing utilization of stabilized iron sulfides (FeS) nanoparticles implies an elevated release of the materials into the environment. To understand potential impacts and underlying mechanisms of nanoparticle-induced stress, we used the transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) technique to characterize the transcriptomes from adult zebrafish exposed to 10\,mg/L carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) stabilized FeS nanoparticles for 96\,h, demonstrating striking differences in the gene expression profiles in liver. The exposure caused significant expression alterations in genes related to immune and inflammatory responses, detoxification, oxidative stress and DNA damage/repair. The complement and coagulation cascades Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway was found significantly up-regulated under nanoparticle exposure. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using twelve genes confirmed the RNA-seq results. We identified several candidate genes commonly regulated in liver, which may serve as gene indicators when exposed to the nanoparticles. Hepatic inflammation was further confirmed by histological observation of pyknotic nuclei, and vacuole formation upon exposure. Tissue accumulation tests showed a 2.2 times higher iron concentration in the fish tissue upon exposure. This study provides preliminary mechanistic insights into potential toxic effects of organic matter stabilized FeS nanoparticles, which will improve our understanding of the genotoxicity caused by stabilized nanoparticles.},

A larval rearing method was adapted to assess the chronic oral toxicity to honey bee larvae of the four most common pesticides detected in pollen and wax - fluvalinate, coumaphos, chlorothalonil, and chloropyrifos - tested alone and in all combinations. All pesticides at hive-residue levels triggered a significant increase in larval mortality compared to untreated larvae by over two fold, with a strong increase after 3 days of exposure. Among these four pesticides, honey bee larvae were most sensitive to chlorothalonil compared to adults. Synergistic toxicity was observed in the binary mixture of chlorothalonil with fluvalinate at the concentrations of 34 mg/L and 3 mg/L, respectively; whereas, when diluted by 10 fold, the interaction switched to antagonism. Chlorothalonil at 34 mg/L was also found to synergize the miticide coumaphos at 8 mg/L. The addition of coumaphos significantly reduced the toxicity of the fluvalinate and chlorothalonil mixture, the only significant non-additive effect in all tested ternary mixtures. We also tested the common ‘inert’ ingredient N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at seven concentrations, and documented its high toxicity to larval bees. We have shown that chronic dietary exposure to a fungicide, pesticide mixtures, and a formulation solvent have the potential to impact honey bee populations, and warrants further investigation. We suggest that pesticide mixtures in pollen be evaluated by adding their toxicities together, until complete data on interactions can be accumulated.},
